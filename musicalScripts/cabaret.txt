A spot of gin. CLIFF Gin? SALLY You've got some? I mean --I think one must. CLIFF No, I don't have any gin. SALLY Oh, well --Prairie -Oysters, then. CLIFF Prairie Oysters? SALLY I practically live on them. It's just raw egg whooshed around in some Worcestershire Sauce. It's heaven for a hangover. CLIFF I haven't got a hangover. (SALLY takes a container of eggs out of her large bag) You carry eggs around with you? SALLY Of course! One never knows when one will have a desperate craving for an omelette -.does one? Actually --I salvaged these from my previous digs. (She takes a bottle of Worcestershire out of her coat pocket) CLIFF That's quite a coat. SALLY It should be. It cost me all I had. Little did I realize how soon I'd be unemployed. CLIFF I gather --your friend Max runs the Kit Kat Klub ... ? SALLY Oh, you're divinely intuitive! I do hope I'm not going to fall madly in love with you. Are you in the movie business in any way? (CLIFF shakes his head) Then you're safe --more or less. Though I do believe a woman can't be a truly great actress till she's had several passionate affairs --and had her heart broken. (She breaks the egg for the Prairie Oyster) Damn. I should have let Ernst pay my cab fare. He's got all that money from Paris. CLIFF From Paris? SALLY He smuggles it in for some political party. CLIFF Ernst is in politics? 32 SALLY Oh, it's all so terribly tedious. Hals and beinbruch! It means neck and leg break. It's supposed to stop it happening. Though I doubt it does. (She drinks) Mmmmmm ... It tastes like peppermint. CLIFF That's because it's my toothbrush mug. SALLY Well, it makes me feel terribly sensual. CLIFF Sally, you've got to understand ... (She picks up a book) SALLY Oh! This is your novel! (squintir:ig at it) It's in German? "Mein Kampf"? CLIFF It's not my novel. I thought I should know something about German politics. SALLY Why? You're an American. (She spots his typewriter) Oh, a typewriter! How creative! You could be the next Dostoevski. Will you allow me to watch you work? Gunther never would. CLIFF Who? SALLY Gunther Werner, he does films. And guess who's going to be in his next one -."The Woman in Room 16"? CLIFF Are you The Woman? SALLY No, unfortunately. I play Penny, an English girl. It's a very good part ... Gunther wrote it specially for me. 33 CLIFF What's it about? SALLY I haven't the foggiest. It's in German! Listen: (Reading with great bravura) "Guten tag. lch kaiser Penny und ich bien Englanderen" CLIFF Nobody's ever translated it for you? SALLY (shakes her head) Oh, but It's so much more fun not knowing. Oh, will you allow me to watch while you write? I promise to be incredibly quiet. CLIFF Look, I don't think I can work with someone else --on the premises. SALLY Then I'll go out --take long, invigorating walks .... CLIFF In the middle of the night? And there's another thing: I'm not a prude. At least ... SALLY Are you homosexual in any way? Bobby says you are. CLIFF Bobby? SALLY One of the boys at the Klub. He says he met you in London -.at the Nightingale Bar ... CLIFF The Nightingale Bar? SALLY Is it possible? CLIFF I guess --anything's possible. I've been to lots of bars .... 34 SALLY And did you and Bobby have an affair? CLIFF Did he say that? SALLY He implied it. CLIFF (carefully) I see .... SALLY Cliff -if you don't mind --I'd should like to withdraw the question. Because --really -.it's none of my business. (Music begins) I think people are people, I really do, Cliff. Don't you? I don't think they should have to explain anything. For example, if I paint my fingernails green and it happens I do paint them green, well, if someone should ask me why, I say: "I think it's pretty, ("I think it's pretty," I reply.) So, if anyone should ask about you and me one day, you have two alternatives: you can either say, "Oh, yes, it's true. We're living in delicious sin." Or you can simply tell the truth and say: (Sings) I MET THIS PERFECTLY MARVELOUS GIRL IN THIS PERFECTLY WONDERFUL PLACE AS I LIFTED A GLASS TO THE START OF A MARVELOUS YEAR BEFORE I KNEW IT SHE CALLED ON THE PHONE.

Only last week I gave you another new mattre$S! FRAULEIN KOST All right! All right!! So I will leave the end of the week --since you insist. FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER l insist? You insist! FRAULEIN KOST So what about the sailors? FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER The sailors? Fraulein Kost --if you wish to continue living here, you must not let me ~ you bringing in any more sailors! You understand? FRAULEIN KOST Very good. So it is the same as always. (She goes into her room and closes the door.) FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER No, it is not the same as always! (She knocks on FRAULEIN KOST's door) Fraulein Kost. Do you hear me? I have put my foot down. (She knocks again) Fraulein Kost! Fraulein Kost!! (SCHULTZ enters from his room carrying a paper bag) SCHULTZ Fraulein Schneider! Good evening! FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER Oh, Herr Schultz! Such a surprise! 43 SCHULTZ You are occupied? FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER No. No. Free as a bird. Please forgive my appearance. SCHULTZ But it is most becoming. FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER Thank you. SCHULTZ I have brought you a little something from the shop. FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER Another little something? (SCHULTZ hands her the bag) SCHULTZ With my compliments. FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER So heavy! But what can it be? Pears? Last Wednesday you brought me pears. And such pears! Apples, possibly? Friday was apples. SCHULTZ Ja, Ja. Friday was apples. FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER So I cannot guess ... SCHULTZ Then open! FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER Herr Schultz. Can I believe what I see?

(FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER opens her bedroom door --then turns to SCHULTZ) I am --overwhelmed! (She goes in and closes the door. The music ends. SCHULTZ is all a-tingle. He makes a decision. He is about to knock on FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER's door when suddenly FRAULEIN KOST opens her door and comes out -.obviously on her way out to find some business. She wonders why SCHULTZ is so far from his own door. But her natural flirtatious instincts take over.) FRAULEIN KOST Good evening, Herr Schultz. SCHULTZ Good evening, Fraulein Kost. I am looking for --I think I dropped -.a small coin --a groschen ... it rolled this way. FRAULEIN KOST You're looking for a groschen? (Meaningfully) I'm looking for two marks. (SCHULTZ gets her meaning. He shakes his head negatively. FRAULEIN KOST exits. SCHULTZ goes again to FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER's door. He knocks. Immediately the door swings open. He swiftly enters. The door closes.) 47 ACT ONE Scene Nine {The EMCEE enters with a small wind-up gramaphone. It is a boy's voice, singing beautifully ... ) THE SUN ON THE MEADOW IS SUMMERY WARM, THE STAG IN THE FORl;:ST RUNS FREE. BUT GATHER TOGETHER TO GREET THE STORM, TOMORROW BELONGS TO ME. THE BRANCH OF THE LINDEN IS LEAFY AND GREEN, THE RHINE GIVES ITS GOLD TO THE SEA. BUT SOMEWHERE A GLORY AWAITS UNSEEN, TOMORROW BELONGS (The EMCEE takes off the needle) EMCEE ... TOME (Cymbal crash) 48 ACT ONE Scene Ten (It is rather dark in CLIFF's room, SALLY is sitting alone --drinking. A bottle of gin is nearby. CLIFF enters, opening a letter) CLIFF I got the letter .... all seven pages. Are you alright? ........ Sally? SALLY (nods) I'm just not speaking today. CLIFF (Affably) Okay. (Looking at the letter) My mother says: "Tell Sally to lay off the gin." SALLY She does not! CLIFF And here's the check!! (He pulls out a check) SALLY Hurray!!! Fifty dollars? How much is that in real money? CLIFF More than enough to pay the rent ... SALLY (hopefully) And dinner at the Adlon? With a bottle of champagne? Oh, Cliff! (He looks at her as if she's off her rocker) A glass of champagne? CLIFF Alright. (SALLY kisses him) Why so gloomy? 49 SALLY (evading the question) Because we never have dinner at the Adlon any more. CLIFF We never did. (Reading the letter) "I'm so excited you've finished your novel, Clifford darling." What a liar I am. SALLY Poor Cliff. It's my fault --If I weren't always dragging you off to party after party ... CLIFF But I love those parties. I. like this whole town. It's so tawdry and terrible and everyone's having such a great time. Like a bunch of kids playing in their room --getting wilder and wilder --and knowing any minute their parents are going to come home. SALLY Maybe you should write about your childhood. CLIFF That was my first novel. SALLY There must be something else to write about... (SALLY beams a smile) CLIFF Sally Bowles? SALLY Of course! I told you I'd inspire you. "Les amores du Sally." But make me ravishing and sublimely seductive --so no man can resist me. Not even a rather strange, handsome young American, who allows me to share his room --and his bed -.and falls desperately in love with me ... (He turns his head away from her) Don't worry! It's only fiction! CLIFF (nods) Now all I've got to do is write it. SALLY I wish I were less distracting. 50 CLIFF It's true. Nobody could work with you around. Not Hemingway --not Tolstoy -.not even Proust ... (She starts packing her suitcase) Oh, no --Sally --I didn't mean ... SALLY But it's time, Cliff. I've never stayed with anyone so long. One must keep mobile, musn't one? CLIFF What's the matter? Got a better offer? SALLY Dozens. I've never stayed so long with anyone. I'm sure you've offers, too. CLIFF Oh, dozens (A game) A couple (SALLY gives him a look) Not one. SALLY Not even Bobby? He phoned today, by the way. (She picks up her suitcase ands starts to exit) CLIFF (Suddenly) Don't go. SALLY What? CLIFF Please, don't go. SALLY Are you serious? 51 CLIFF The hell with Bobby. Maybe --I like you here. I need you. I need -.··· The truth is, Sally --when you're out all night --I can't sleep. Our little bed suddenly seems so empty. I've never felt this way before about --anyone --anyone at all. SALLY You truly mean this? CLIFF More than I've ever meant anything. SALLY Oh, darling ..... CLIFF You want to tell me what's wrong? SALLY Nothing. Not a thing. (She sits) I'm pregnant. CLIFF Are you sure? (SALLY nods) Well --what are we going to do? SALLY What am I going to do? The usual thing, I suppose. CLIFF You've done it before? SALLY Thousands of times. CLIFF Don't you think you ought to check with the father? SALLY Why? CLIFF Well --to help pay for the doctor --for one thing. 52 SALLY I do so hate it, Cliff. That awful doctor. CLIFF Then maybe ... SALLY· And --anyway --who~ the father? (laughing) Could be anyone! CLIFF (dawning realization) Could be me. Sally, it could be me. SALLY (considering it a possibility for an instant) True. CLIFF And Sally --if it's mine ... SALLY We'll never know --will we? CLIFF We .Q.Q.U.]_g_. SALLY Oh, yes! Nine months of being sick every morning. And then --the happy day! And whom does it resemble? Max! A horrid little German infant --with a moustache --ordering us about. CLIFF I'm willing to take that chance. SALLY Or --perhaps --an Oriental. I seem to recall a rather taciturn Malaysian ... CLIFF Sally --will you do me a favor and shut up! Can we just be serious for a minute? SALLY (surpressing hysteria) I doubt it, Cliff. 53 CLIFF This could be the best thing that ever happened to us .... SALLY I doubt it, Cliff. CLIFF We're drifting --We have no focus to our lives. A baby would make all the difference. I know it would to me. I'd get a job. I'd have to. I'd stay home nights: write the novel -.wash the diapers --the whole bit! Listen, Sally --will you do one thing for me -.please? At least --think about it --before you see the doctor ... ? SALLY MAYBE THIS TIME, I'll BE LUCKY MAYBE THIS TIME, HE'LL STAY MAYBE THIS TIME FOR THE FIRST TIME LOVE WON'T HURRY AWAY HE WILL HOLD ME FAST I'll BE HOME AT LAST NOT A LOSER ANYMORE LIKE THE LAST TIME AND THE TIME BEFORE EVERYBODY LOVES A WINNER SO NOBODY LOVED ME: 'LADY PEACEFUL,' 'LADY HAPPY,' THAT'S WHAT I LONG TO BE ALL THE ODDS ARE IN MY FAVOR SOMETHING'S BOUND TO BEGIN IT'S GOT TO HAPPEN, HAPPEN SOMETIME MAYBE THIS TIME I'll WIN EVERYBODY LOVES A WINNER SO NOBODY LOVED ME: 'LADY PEACEFUL,' 'LADY HAPPY,' THAT'S WHAT I LONG TO BE ALL THE ODDS ARE IN MY FAVOR SOMETHING'S BOUND TO BEGIN IT'S GOT TO HAPPEN, HAPPEN SOMETIME MAYBE THIS TIME .............. ..

If you are interested, I think in the next few days. Thank you. And I promise you are giving help to a very good cause. CLIFF Well, whatever it is, don't tell me. I don't want to know. ERNST As you wish. CLIFF How about going tomorrow? ERNST Tomorrow? But, we are all going to the party .... CLIFF I think I'll skip it. 55 ERNST But why, Clifford? CLIFF Let's just say: I'm turning over a new leaf. SALLY Turning over a new tree. ERNST And you, Sally ... ? You are turning over as well? SALLY Who knows? I mean--Cliff and I may just turn out to be the two most utterly boring people you ever met! CLIFF So, what would I have to do? ERNST It is so very simple: You go to an address I will give you --you pick up a small briefcase --you bring it back to Berlin. And I pay you seventy-five marks! SALLY Seventy-five marks! ERNST Yes, and that is only the beginning. (to CLIFF) So, you will go to Paris? CLIFF Absolutely. Anything for a buck.

She is halfway across the floor with one of them when FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER enters) FRAULEIN KOST All right! There is no need to say it. I know it by heart already. So --no lectures, please.--about sailors. They are just lonesome, patriotic German boys. I have a duty. (SCHULTZ comes out of FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER's room and takes in the scene. It is clear he has been inside with FRAULEIN • SCHNEIDER. The atmosphere crackles. Now, glorying in the moment, and for FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER's benefit, FRAULEIN KOST hugs and kisses the third SAILOR at great length) FRAULEIN KOST Goodnight, Rudy --you must be sure to come back again soon. At any time. (Looking at FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER) Bring your friends. Go home. (The SAILOR exits. FRAULEIN KOST waltzes up to FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER) Ah --good evening, Fraulein Schneider. A busy evening --no? I see we are -.after all --sisters under the skin. SCHULTZ Fraulein Kost! FRAULEIN KOST Yes? SCHULTZ This fine lady is not your sister! This fine lady has just honored me by consenting to give me her hand in marriage! FRAULEIN KOST (Really amazed) Marriage? SCHULTZ Yes, we marry in -~ three weeks. 60 FRAULEIN KOST Three weeks! SCHULTZ So a little respect for the future Frau Schultz --if you please! FRAULEIN KOST Ja! Ja! Frau Schultz? (FRAULEIN KOST --chastened --exits into her room) FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER Thank you --Herr Schultz. You were --supreme. SCHULTZ But what else could I do? FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER Such a magnificent lie to preserve my reputation. SCHULTZ But why did I say three weeks? Why not three months? Three years? This way she will find out the truth so quickly ......... Unless ........ .. FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER Unless? SCHULTZ Unless what? FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER You said: "unless." SCHULTZ But it is foolish! I mean --after all --who would have me? An elderly widower --balding --with heartburn --and a little fruit ... FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER Am I such a bargain then? An unbeautiful spinster with some rooms to let -.poorly furnished. SCHULTZ I work fourteen hours a day. FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER I do my own scrubbing. 61 SCHULTZ My right leg bothers me. FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER I have such palpitations. SCHULTZ I'm not a well man. FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER Am I a well woman? SCHULTZ What are we talking about? We're alive! And what good is it --alone? So if you would even consider --marriage .... ? (A long pause) FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER I will consider it. SCHULTZ But take your time, by all means. No hurry. FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER We should discuss it. We must not marry merely to humiliate Fraulein Kost. SCHULTZ I assure you, Fraulein Schneider.

If you marry Herr Schultz --whatever problems come up --you'll still have each other. FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER All my life I have managed for myself --and it is too old a habit to change. I have battled alone, and I have survived. There was a war --and I survived. There was a revolution --and I survived. There was an inflation --billions of marks for one loaf of bread --but I survived! And if the Nazis come --I will survive. And if the Communists come --I will still be here --renting these rooms! For, in the end, what other choice have I? This --is my world! (Softly) I regret very much returning the fruit bowl. It is truly magnificent. I regret --everything. (FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER exits) SALLY Oh, Cliff -should I speak to her? CLIFF What would you say? SALLY Oh --that it will all work itself out. Remember how she was about my staying here? (imitating FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER) "It is not possible! And I cannot consider ... " CLIFF Shut up, Sally. SALLY What? CLIFF It's not funny. 81 SALLY Well, it seems nothing amuses you anymore. It was such fun today with Bobby and Victor. They laugh at everything. Especially the thought of you and me in a cottage at the end of a lane. They found that hysterical. (She gets her coat) They're waiting for me this very minute --to rehearse my numbers. So I really must go. (CLIFF dusts off his typewriter) CLIFF The fact is --you're going a lot further than the Klub. SALLY lam? CLIFF We're going home. My home.

Running away to America? CLIFF We're not running away. We're going home. 82 SALLY Oh, certainly --that's fine for you. But what about me? My career? CLIFF You've got a new career. SALLY (Goes to CLIFF) But I can work at the Klub for several months at least. And then --in November -.Oh, Cliff, I want the world for our baby --all the most elegant, expensive things ... CLIFF We'll talk about it tomorrow --on the train.

(He pushes down) And don't move! Or, better yet --start packing! There's plenty to do. (He goes towards the door, carrying his typewriter) Call the Klub. Tell them goodbye. (He exits.

So there must be something else .... lt is because of that Jew at the party. (CLIFF hits ERNST. As he does this, MAX and BODYGUARDS come to ERNST's help. ERNST leaves them to finish CLIFF off.

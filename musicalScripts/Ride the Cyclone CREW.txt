RIDE THE CYCLONE (We barely see a figure with its back tothe audience in a Saint Cassian girl's tunic, as if she is lit by the faintest beam of moonlight. Although we see her body, her head seems tobe entirely missing in her silhouette.) #1 DREAM OF LIFE OPENING JANE I KNOW THIS DREAM OF LIFE IS NEVER ENDING IT GOES AROUND AND 'ROUND AND 'ROUND AGAIN YOU KNOW THE SUN IS RISING WHILE DESCENDING IT GOES ON AND ON AND NEVER ENDS (At the end JANE DOE magically disappears. In darkness ... ) #lA AMAZING KARNAK ORGAN (A mechanical fortune-telling machine is revealed, circa 1920's penny arcade. The fortuneteller is an imposing figure with a majestic beard and glowing eyes.) KARNAK Hello. I am the Amazing Karnak. This is not a boast but rather what it says on my legal patent as a precognition machine. I was designed to predict the exact cause, time, and place of someone's death. A rather morbid function, I grant you; which is precisely why I was set on "family fun novelty mode" when sold to the Wonderville traveling fairground ... Turns out ... being told the place and time of your death in front of your family, with a mouthful of corndog at a fairground, is the very opposite of fun. I can even predict my own demise. I always could -tonight in this warehouse, in a little over an hour. #lB VIRGIL BASS SOLO BEGINS (We see a projection of a rat running across the projection screen through the following text) Meet my executioner, a rat I've named Virgil. For the last two years Virgil has been steadily chewing on my power cable. In a little over an hour, Virgil shall chew his way through the rubber, biting down on two hundred volts of electricity ... instantly killing us both. As there is nothing more base than Death ... I've decided for tonight's concert, Virgil shall play the bass. (We see the life-sized version of VIRGIL, a human-sized rat who appearstodo a very skilled, short bass solo.) #2 KARNAK ORGAN PART 2/URANIUM KARNAK (CON'T) Before we begin, let m.e lay down some ground rules. The first rule: one that has baffled theatre goers since the days of Aeschylus ... the arm.rest to your left is yours; the one to your right is your neighbour's. If you believe that both arm.rests are yours exclusively ... you are part of the problem.. Also, please turn off your cell phones. I assure you that none of the calls you are about to receive will have life-altering consequences ... except for one of you ... m.y most sincere condolences. Accidents happen. (The curtains part and the choir appears.) Speaking of which, ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Saint Cassian Chamber Choir of Uranium. City, Saskatchewan: (The choir, hunched over almost lifeless ... as they enter the stage, they seem tobe resurrecting before our eyes, Once they are in place, we get Resurrection SFX and video as they jerk back to life, ending with them snapping up into their choir formation. The piano vamp on URANIUM starts immediately.) OCEAN I thank you, dear adjudicator, for considering the Saint Cassian Chamber Choir for our senior concert. KARNAK This is them. on Monday, September 14th . OCEAN We are thrilled to be here, yet again, at the Kiwanis International singing com.petition Last year we came in second place. KARNAK They were the only choir in com.petition. OCEAN This just shows the high standards of excellence in Kiwanis -even in com.petition against yourself, you can still walk away a loser. Constance? CONSTANCE Our first song is by Father Louis P. Marcus, our choir conductor ... He was inspired by traditional African folk music-specifically The Lion King. (CONSTANCE fives a "That can't be right" expression OCEAN prompts her to continue) It's about our hometown, Uranium. Enjoy. (Throughout the first part of this movement RICKY POTTS plays the tambourine, and visibly hates every minute of it. MISCHA is barely paying attention, stealing moments to look at his phone, to the irritation of OCEAN. The choreography for this first section is that of a small town choir, imagine that it has been choreographed by an eighty-six year old Catholic priest.) OCEAN URANIUM KIDS (EXCEPT RICKY) URANIUM THAT'S OUR TOWN, OUR FRIENDLY TOWN OCEAN URANIUM KIDS (EXCEPT RICKY) URANIUM THAT'S OUR TOWN, OUR HIGHWAY TOWN NOEL KIDS (EXCEPT RICKY) THE SKY IS ALMOST BLUE HERE 000 GRAIN ELEVATORS TOO HERE 000 KIDS (EXCEPT RICKY) THE PRIDE AND JOY OF SWEET SASKATCHEWAN CONSTANCE  KIDS (EXCEPT RICKY)  WE CAME HERE FOR  000  THE HALF-LIFE  STAYED HERE FOR  000  OUR WHOLE LIFE  KIDS (EXCEPT RICKY)  TO GIVE THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD PLUTONIUM OCEAN URANIUM KIDS (EXCEPT RICKY) URANIUM THAT'S OUR TOWN, OUR FRIENDLY TOWN OHNONO WE WILL NEVER LEA VE THIS TOWN AT ALL #3 MINOR TURN (The lights shifts starkly and the children float around space in bewildered unease) KARNAK Tonight I shall speak of these teenagers, whose tales ended abruptly on a roller coaster in a small Canadian town in the middle of nowhere.

Allow me to introduce you to the mystery contestant. .. #5 JANE DOE'S ENTRANCE (The curtain slowly rises spilling with smoke. JANE DOE is revealed. A haunting figure with blond dolly locks, white face, and black eyes. She clutches a headless doll. ... JANE moves like a marionette with broken strings. For haunting effect, her mic has (long tail of hall) reverb on it. Which continues throughout the entire show.) (Sing talking, child-like) Jane Doe is what the coroner said, They found my body, not my head, No parents came, and so they Never learned ... My name, or who I used to be. My life, an unsolved mystery. From ashes I was made, and ashes I return. And so I walk alone and wonder Why? WHY? WHY?

Catchphrase: (Lights suddenly down only on JANE.) #SA JANE'S CATCHPHRASE JANE (In one breath, should time out with music) When a lioness has children, she stops making love to the lion. The lion gets jealous, sometimes so jealous he eats the children. You'd think this would upset the lioness. Far from it, they make love again, like the children never existed. I find that idea terrifying. (BEAT) CONSTANCE I'm going to stand a little farther away from you, okay? #SB SNARE ROLL (Lights circle around the theatre, CONSTANCE runs over to OCEAN, JANE follows her, OCEAN runs over to KARNAK, CONSTANCE follows OCEAN. An the end of the snare the follow spot lands on OCEAN) KARNAK Ocean Rosenberg ... you are first. OCEAN Why? KARNAK Alas, if only you hadn't burned off those three questions right at the top. OCEAN It's just, when you tie the room together ... I think Constance is going to seem like the natural choice for that slot. CONSTANCE You want me to go first? OCEAN Oh, if you insist, um ... Mister Whatever? I think Constance and I are going to tradesies. KARNAK (Flatly) No tradesies. OCEAN (Without skipping a beat) Well I'm happy about that actually. Sure, I'll go first. I just want to say two things ... First, I don't know how it is in your culture, but in ours, playing games where peoples' lives are on the table? Super illegal. Second, so inspiring. That a man encased in a literal box, has learned to think outside of it. (claps) #6 OCEAN'S BUMPER (The bumpers are moments when the specified character approachesKARNAK to have their fortune read while he narrates, underscored by thematic music relevant to the character. The rest of the characters rearrange the scene and also participate in a visual retelling of the mini-biography.) KARNAK Ocean O'Connell Rosenberg, born December 22nd , Capricorn, the ambitious nature. (OCEAN pulls KARNAK'S lever. The first photo montage occurs, with SFX. The photo montage is a flurry of portraits of character from babyhood to seventeen.) Favorite ride: the Bumper Cars. (OCEAN does a bumper car gesture) Ocean was born into a family of far left-of-center humanists who moved to Northern Saskatchewan to live a carbon-free lifestyle. (JANE & MISCHA enter as OCEAN'S parents, hippy dancing. JANE is still lost. [No matter what character she is playing, so does the role stiffly.]) The hemp needle-point sign above the household's toilet read: "If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown ... scoop it out with your hand and put it in the compost". Yet in between all the drum circles, Marxist parables, and cheese sandwiches made of human breast milk. .. Ocean could never shake the feeling she was the white sheep of her family. It was only at the age of eight, when she found amongst her parents' record collection an album called "Up with People" ... (CONSTANCE, NOEL & RICKY enter with matching ties and collars as in Up With People! ... super chirpy.) The cloying positivity of this pro-capitalist gaggle of teen crooners brought tears to her eyes. Perhaps the peppiest thing Halliburton has ever produced. High school president, straight-A student, Ocean O'Connell Rosenberg ... the most successful girl in town. OCEAN Judges, student body, colleagues, friends ... ominous novelty machine ... I had a speech prepared for this very occasion, but I simply cannot read it. (She rips a piece of paper.) MISCHA (To Noel) How could she have speech for this? OCEAN I am just going to speak from my heart. I've known most of these folks since pre-K ... I love them all ... Constance Blackwood, my best friend forever, my BFF .(CONSTANCE is sitting next to JANE who has locked eyes with her, giving her the thousand mile stare) CONSTANCE Ocean, she's .OCEAN Don't interrupt, sweetie. Constance is the salt of the earth ... Our 1Mary Main-Street 1 looking for her 1Joe Six-Pack 1 Sure, she has some serious self-esteem issues, why ¥ wouldn't she?

U-POP! CONSTANCE We get pretty crazy sometimes ... OCEAN Constance Eleanor Blackwood. You know I find the word 1crazy1 offensive. CONSTANCE (Gritting teeth) That's why Ocean scripts all our improvs in advance. OCEAN My time, Constance, my time ... (She sits her back next to JANE, who locks eyes with her again while CONSTANCE grimaces) OCEAN (CONT'D) Look, I've seen enough reality TV to get what you want us to do here ... Who's the best? I mean sure, grades, humanitarian efforts, extracurricular activities, prestigious university, spiritual mastery of both Judaism. and Catholicism-Nailed m.y Confirmation and Bat Mitzvah, in the same week. And I'm. not even bragging about that because it's against m.y Buddhist beliefs .. .I am. the best here, by any metric of society, I get that. ... (trembling voice breaking with emotion, she is moved by herself being moving) ... but if that's how worth is measured, I want no part of it! Look. .. some of us are left wing, some of us are right wing ... but the last time I checked it takes two wings to fly!! We are comm.unity! We are Family!

A linearphotomontage of baby pictures, child pictures, young teen, to current yearbook photo.) Favorite ride: the ferris wheel. Very early on in Noel's life ... his mother realized two things. (Beat) The second was his penchant for all things nihilistic. (Ricky enters with a wand, zapping imaginary wizards) While other children acted out Harry Potter, Noel acted out French New Wave Cinema. (NOEL grabs RICKY'S wand breaksit and takes a drag from it, 1 using it as cigarette) In Grade seven ... during the Saint Cassian Christmas Nativity pageant, Noel was suspended for suddenly breaking into this excerpt from "Waiting for Godot". KIDS 000000000 000000000 0000000 (NOEL, CONSTANCE and JANE DOE put on Shepards hats.) NOEL There is no room at this Inn, for it is Christmas ... (as Didi, French accent) Shall we hang ourselves? JANE (as Goga, French accent) I hear it gives you an erection. NOEL (as Didi, French accent) Then we must hang ourselves ... immediately. (Stark light shift and unsettling wind blows as Noel glares at the audience intensely and smokes an imaginary cigarette.

I tried to go as her every year for Halloween-I always chickened out ... And I'd go as something like C3P-O ... but in my heart, I was Lola Lola, dressed up as C3P-0 ... that was always my Halloween costume's subtext. Mom tells me I've got to try to blend in, so I tried really hard to dial it back. .. I had to ... we live in a town where every year on July 11th when Seven Eleven gives out free Slurpees it's like seriously, the major cultural event of the year .... I'm not even making a joke right now. It's like, a Slurpee Woodstock. I was born in the wrong town, the wrong country, the wrong era! I wanted to feel, goddamn it. I wanted bad love. I wanted a man that would drive me to drink. I craved dissipation. I wanted to wake up in an alleyway in my own vomit, missing teeth. I wanted to drink myself to death on the cup of life ... "Anyone who hasn't experienced the ecstasy of betrayal knows nothing about ecstasy at all.11Jean Genet. I was a sexual provocateur and a novelist, who never wrote a novel. .. or had sex .... (A slide comes up of NOEL in a Taco Bell uniform.) NOEL (Slightly horrified) What's that? KARNAK I was hoping you could tell me. NOEL No! (muttering) I worked at the Taco Bell, in the food court of the Mega Mall just outside Uranium City. (defeated) I had to work somewhere, we had no money. I was saving up to move to France. KARNAK They named a meal after your passing, "The Noel Gruber Hungry Hombre Meal". They catered your funeral for free. They even played Christina Aguilera' s "Beautiful" on the bagpipes. NOEL I only said I liked that song once. Ironically ... a joke was my final song. All those wasted hours in that horrible mall dreaming of .KARNAK I feel this is a perfect occasion for a song about affordable Mexican cuisine.

He transforms into a Louise Brooks femme fatale, wearing fishnet stockings and high heels.) #10 NOEL'S LAMENT (Pause) Fine!

CONSTANCE enters as his mother) Mischa was conceived in a little town outside Odessa in Ukraine by a factory worker named Tamara. His mother, after being part of the clean up crew in Chernobyl, was dying of prolonged exposure to Uranium. (She hugs him and he waves goodbye) KARNAK (CONT'D) Wanting her son to be safe, she decided to put him up for adoption-forging his birth certificate, she claimed he was two years old, and was recently potty trained. (OCEAN and NOEL play MISHA'S straight laced adoptive parents, they act out the following narration) When Mischa came to Canada, his adoptive parents were surprised to see their toddler had five o'clock shadow, and a slight trace of alcohol on his breath. They put him in the basement and his adoptive mother would prepare food and leave it for him on the top of the stairs. On the rare occasion he would run into his new parents-the mother would weep, and the father would shoo him away like a horsefly. (MISCHA magically produces a wireless microphone) So began an inexhaustible rage. He turned to the last bastion of pure strength and masculinity in society: self-aggrandizing commercialized hiphop. This is how Mischa became, the angriest boy in town. MISCHA (Into wireless mic) Yo! I want to talk about feeling. Ukrainian men have two emotion: Rage! And Passion. People always be hating on me and my mad skillz, 'cause I am best rapper in all of North Eastern Saskatchewan. Grab yo dicks if you in the 306! Brah! You might know me as 'Bad Egg' on the YouTube. I'm well known there. That's where I met my shorty, Talia. She's from Kiev, from my country, and she gave me mostly positive feedback on my YouTube comment wall ... and then we became mad passionate all-night lovers on Facebook, Twitter ... we made love with each other in my native language on all of the social media networks. She is now my fiance ..... we were engaged ... I was saving up to move back to Ukraine and we were going to .. . (he gets emotional) Too much passion ... now Rage! I have no respect for this country! Fact: you want to know what Canada is leading supplier of, to whole world? Two things: mustard seeds ... and Uranium. That's great for hotdogs, yes ... but not so good for Ukraine. So thank you for killing my mother. And for indirectly killing me.

Gemini: the dual nature. (RICKY pulls the lever ... photomontage, however his personal pictures are soon replaced with classic origin scenes from comic books: Superman lifting the car as a kids. Spidey in the lab getting bit, Bruce Wayne standing over his dead parents, the Silver Surfer, etc.). KARNAK (CONT'D) Favourite ride, the Gravitron. (He does the motion of the Gravitron. Mischa enters as Ricky's father, the pastor, wearing a cravat, large Jim Jones sunglasses and a midway booth stuffed snake, preaching ... ) Born of a semi-renowned Pentecostal pastor, Richard at a young age toured the province with his father, spreading the good news, speaking in tongues, and handling their saw-scaled Viper Snake, JoJo. The bad news was that after witnessing JoJo give his father a lethal bite during a rousing sermon, Richard was thoroughly traumatized, and lost his power of speech. (RICKY stands centre stage, transforming tothe state after his father has been bitten. NOEL and CONSTANCE enter as RICKY'S elderly grandparents) Moving in with his grandparents, who were collectively 180 years old, his life consisted of feeding their 19 cats and reading the comic books he got for his birthday. Well meaning but dotty with age, Richard's grandparents celebrated his 8th birthday every two weeks, until he was seventeen. Patronized, pushed around, and condescended to in high school, far from growing bitter, Richard developed an elaborate playground in his synapses, where he became his own best friend. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the fantasia of Richard Potts, the most imaginative boy in town. #15 SP ACE AGE BACHELOR MAN (Throughout this song, RICKY shifts between his meeker self and his heroic persona.

THIS IS THE NEW SONG WE SING FOR BIRTHDAYS KIDS (EXCEPT JANE) BOUNCY AND MERRY AND NOT QUITE AS SCARY THE NEW BIRTHDAY SONG (They dance around JANE.

Cross.fade to RICKY and JANE playing with a glockenspiel.) JANE How do we know it's my birthday? RICKY ... How do we know it's not your birthday? JANE People have names on pretend birthdays, too. RICKY You could call yourself Savannah ... JANE What's a Savannah? RICKY Savannah is a special name I was saving up, but you can have it. 1Cause everything I've been saving has to go.

Thank you. MISCHA Budmo! (translating) May we live forever .... (Smiling at each other bittersweetly) And your life was tragic. Cut down before the poems could ever come out of you. You are tragic. NOEL You think so? MISCHA (Sincerely) You make me weep just looking at you. So, so tragic ... NOEL That is the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. (Cross fade to ... ) CONSTANCE ... That was nice of you ... throwing that party for that girl like that. OCEAN It's what I do. Strange, in our predicament she's somehow the saddest. CONSTANCE I totally agree. OCEAN (Sharply turns to CONSTANCE) You're not thinking of voting for her, are you? CONSTANCE No, I'm voting for you! Naturally! Of course! Ocean ... um ... do you think you'd ever kind of like ... vote for me? OCEAN Of course I would, you're my best friend ... but it's by a unanimous vote ... so I kind of have to ... CONSTANCE (Flatly) Vote for yourself. OCEAN (grabs CONSTANCE's hand) You know I envy you? CONSTANCE No you don't, Ocean. OCEAN No I do ... I mean I got straight A's since I was in grade one. I was working toward something. I was building a life. You, you were satisfied doing nothing, making cupcakes ... eating them. You are what the Taoists call an 'uncarved block.' CONSTANCE (incredulous but restrained) I'm a block? OCEAN Just learn to take a compliment. CONSTANCE (seething) Thanks ... OCEAN I thought my life had meaning, turns out it didn't.

Music stops.) OWCH! You just punched me! ... in the frickin' boob! CONSTANCE (Not sorry) Sorry. #17 A CONSTANCE'S BUMPER KARNAK Constance Blackwood, born November 14th. Scorpio: the secret nature. (CONSTANCE pulls the lever ... photomontage.) KARNAK (CONT'D) Favorite ride: The Cyclone. The only honor Constance Blackwood was to receive in her short lifetime was 'nicest girl in homeroom'. Three years in a row. An award she secretly threw in the dumpster behind her local Kentucky Fried Chicken on her way home. When the children of St. Cassian signed Constance's yearbook, they wrote things like ... RICKY ... Wow, you seemed so nice ... KARNAK ... Or ... NOEL .. .I never really met you -you seemed friendly. KARNAK Those pages in Constance's yearbook were carefully removed with an exacto knife. And burnt. Constance Blackwood, the nicest girl in town. CONSTANCE (Bluntly, frankly) So I lost my virginity to a carnie in a port-o-potty before I died. Like three hours before. It was kind of porno. He was like ancient, like thirty-two. And he had this tattoo on his forearm ... it was of two skeletons having sex, and it said, "Born to Bone" on the bottom of it. (LIGHT up on MISCHA wearing the Iron Maiden shirt.) MISCHA (As CARNIE) Isn't my tattoo the stupidest thing you've ever seen? (CONSTANCE laughs.) CONSTANCE I fake laughed when he said that because you should always laugh at guys' jokes, or they'll think you' re a cow. My mom and dad own the Blackwood Cafe in town. It's been in our family since, like forever. The Blackwoods have been in Uranium since they opened the mines ... my family had pride when it came to that. 'Til I went to high school and having pride about our town was only like the lamest thing you could ever think to believe. After a while I started feeling kind of crummy about stuff, like ashamed. At the cafe, I would catch myself looking at my mom thinking, "what a loser, a stupid dead.end loser, in a stupid dead-end town." My parents were good people and all I could do was think horrible things about them. I really wish I never thought those things ... But I got so angry that I was born in the only family in Uranium that raised their kid to think it was okay to do your working, living and dying there. And it just got all kinds of poison after that. Anyway, my virginity ... I just wanted to get it out of the way. I just wanted to do it, so I didn't have to think about doing it anymore. No, actually ... I just wanted to lose it in the most horrible possible way. "Constance the lifer, lost it to a carnie, in a crap box, in a crappy town! Why, of course she did ... " And then I rode the Cyclone with the other kids in the choir ... and that's when the accident happened. #17B GUITAR SUGARCLOUDS UNDERSCORE (With growing intensity and speed throughout, a volcano of memories) We were at the top of the loop, when the roller coaster made this kind of screaming metal sound. Sparks were shooting all over the place. And then the screaming and the sparks just stopped .... and there was like this weightlessness .... My heart jumped like a gazillion beats a second, but I didn't scream like the other kids .... No, I was just soaking it all in,' cause on a certain level it was so rad .... sailing through the air upside down, you could see all the other rides. And it was like something unlocked in me; my heart just welled up with all this love for everything. Images and all this feeling flooded into me. Like climbing back into my bed in the morning and feeling the heat left over from my body, hanging upside down from the monkey bars until my head starts to tingle, smelling jiffy markers, listening to music and dancing around my room before going out to a party and pretending I'm going to have the perfect time, finishing an essay, un-doing a knot, pizza night, Halloween, watching my baby brother dance naked to ABBA, being in the choir at the height of the Hallelujah chorus and feeling all the voices rattle my bones. I started laughing like a crazy person, giddy with endorphins, all dancing leprechauns and rainbows and unicorns, streams of chocolate, whirling rides, flashing lights. CONSTANCE (CONT'D) There's no shame in loving my small town. The only good things that happened to me happened in Uranium. It took a horrible accident for me to realize how goddamn wonderful everything is. #18 JAWBREAKER/SUGARCLOUD CONSTANCE I USED TO THINK THAT LIFE WAS JUST A JAWBREAKER YEAH, YOU SUCK AND YOU SUCK AND YOU SUCK AND YOU SUCK AND YOU SUCK SOME MORE YEAH, YOU SUCK SOME MORE AT FIRST IT SEEMS SO SWEET AND THE COLORS COME AND GO LIKE THE SEASONS COME AND GO THE SLUSH AND RAIN AND SNOW 'TIL YOU CAN'T TASTE NO MORE ENSEMBLE 000 000 000 KIDS SO YOU SUCK SOME MORE CONSTANCE I USED TO THINK THAT LIFE WAS JUST A HEART BREAKER THAT JUST BREAKS AND IT BREAKS AND IT BREAKS AND IT BREAKS 'TIL YOU CAN'T BREAK NO MORE 'TIL YOU CAN'T TAKE NO MORE ENSEMBLE AAAAH AAAAH AHHHH YOU CAN'T TAKE NO MORE ENSEMBLE (CONT'D) AHHHHOOOOO AHHHHOOOOO (This next part of the number should feel like a rock concert.

She whispers to her wordlessly, ''I'm sorry". They hug) KARNAK Final vote, (SFX: FINAL VOTE TRILL) KARNAK (CONT'D) Ocean Rosenberg. (A light falls on OCEAN, who stares, lost ... clearly moved by CONSTANCE's number ... the other children are suddenly frozen in respective poses in specials-still. Frozen in statues of their characters.) OCEAN Huh? KARNAK It has been decided that you shall have the final vote. OCEAN Over what? KARNAK Who lives or dies. OCEAN ... I thought we all had to vote on that? That's what you told us. KARNAK I've decided the final vote will come down to the one with the highest grade point average. You are the winner. OCEAN That doesn't strike me as very fair. KARNAK In five minutes, all bets are off. OCEAN What happens in five minutes? KARNAK My appointment with a rat named Virgil. And then my death. After that, I'm not entirely sure. OCEAN (CONT'D) Um. ... and if I just vote for myself, what is the moral? If I chose myself ... if I choose myself, the moral of the story is that hum.ans suck. KARNAK That would be a valid interpretation, yes. OCEAN No, no, no we're going to honor the original agreement. We will all vote on who com.es back. #19 DREAM OF JANE'S LIFE (The curtain slowly rises, revealing a majestic light and smoke.) What's that? KARNAK The other side. You merely walk in ...

She exhales.) (To everyone in the room) OCEAN (CONT'D) It shouldn't be me. (She looks at CONSTANCE who looks at JANE, OCEAN nods) We died young, by total accident. But to say that if one dies young, they die needlessly .that is to discount the years they had. The experiences they had ... I would gladly take my seventeen years over nothing. Who do I vote for? ... The girl who can't remember any of it. Her ... we had a life-she didn't. That's my vote. #19A JANE DOE VIDEO MUSIC BEGINS (Ocean checks in with all the kids, they gently nod in agreement.) Motioned carried.

You will soar to great heights. Be sure to Ride the Cyclone. (KARNAK is dead, but the children remain huddled together, heavy breathing. Light shift.

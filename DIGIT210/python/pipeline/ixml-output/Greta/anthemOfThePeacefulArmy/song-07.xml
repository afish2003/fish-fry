F           C    Eb    Bb             F
 Let the new day shine its light on me
F             C     Eb     Bb               F
 Shake the old way, nights too dark to see
F          C           Eb     Bb               F
 Free tomorrow, it's bright with something new
F                C      Eb  Bb             F
 Celieve the righteous, and it will come true

<section type="Pre-Chorus"><mdiv>
C                Bb          F
 You're a child in the garden
C                   Gm                 Bb    F
 You're growing up   I'll watch you bloom
C               Bb              F
 And your dreams are not forgotten
C              Gm       Bb C
 You'll be a woman soon

<section type="Chorus"><mdiv>
F                 C         Bb             C
Love isn't greed it's a need that goes unspoken
F               C              Bb        C
 Love doesn't leave when you fade away
F             C          Bb                   C
 Pain isn't vain if it means your heart's been broken
F            C         Bb            C
 Pain is the same as a means to heal

<section type="Verse 2"><mdiv>
F          C          Eb   Bb           F
 Let me try love, you know I'm only one
F           C        Eb    Bb             F
 Live or die love, I tried and to me won
F              C            Eb   Bb          F
 We're the future, it's hard to say we know
F          C       Eb   Bb              F
 And the suture is what we have to sew

 And your dreams are not forgotten
C              Gm       Bb C
 You'll be a woman soon

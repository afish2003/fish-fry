<section type="Verse 1"><mdiv>
    E          A
Enter the flow
    E
Dharma, Divine
    E          A
Succeeding signs
                         E
Carbon dancing through time
E            A                      E
Give me the truth, and I will sing on
E              A
My universe is so
A                      E
To ask the questions unknown
E
Is to respond
    A
Woah
 
E                      A                 E            A    E     A     G    B

<section type="Chorus"><mdiv>
E            A       E
To comet across the blistering hue
E            A       E
Beyond the spaces of false and true
E              A              E
Away from the world we have riddled with scars
E                 A           E
To be wholly free and amongst the stars

<section type="Verse 2"><mdiv>
    E          A
You are the land
               E
The sea and the sky, woah
    E          A
The explanation why
                         E
We're tied to all things as one
E            A                      E
Rhythm of space
             E
Expansion of soul
                  A
A force beyond control
                          E                    A
Travelers in time searching for the unknown
 
E                      A                 E            A    E     A     G    B
Ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram

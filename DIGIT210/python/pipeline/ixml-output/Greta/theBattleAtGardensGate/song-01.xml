Eb         Bb         Ab
Sorrows of the Earth
        Eb            Bb          Ab
May our tears of rain wash down to bathe you
Eb                Bb        Ab         Eb               Bb         Ab
This is what life is worth When the fires still burn and rage all around
Cm          Bb          Gm  Ab
Can you hear that dreadful sound?
Cm             Bb     Gm    Ab     Ab
Fire still burning on  the ground

Eb              Bb         Ab        Eb           Bb         Ab
Follow the fearsome sound As they march to battle, hear the drums pound
Eb              Bb       Ab       Eb             Bb         Ab
We do not fight for war But to save the lives of those who do so
Cm          Bb          Gm  Ab
Can you hear that dreadful sound?

Fire still burning on  the ground

 Ascending to the stars as one

Eb              Bb        Ab     Eb          Bb      Ab
Marching across the land Is a peaceful army joining the band
Eb           Bb       Ab
Walking hand in hand
      Eb          Bb       Ab
To an anthem loudly sung where they stand
Cm          Bb          Gm  Ab
Can you hear that dreadful sound?
Cm             Bb     Gm    Ab     Ab
Fire still burning on  the ground

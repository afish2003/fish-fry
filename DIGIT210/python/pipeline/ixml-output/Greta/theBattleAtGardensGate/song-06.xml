<section type="Verse 1"><mdiv>
Fm/C                Abmaj7/C C       C7
Bathing in the light        around us
Eb/Bb                Gm/Bb   F           Fsus2
Praying for the night     to comfort thee
Fm/C                Abmaj7/C  C     C7
Dancing on the coals        below us
Eb/Bb                Gm/Bb   F          Fsus2
Praying for the flood     to set us free
 
 </mdiv></section>
<section type="Chorus"><mdiv>
        Fm              Gm
And the planet is still turning
        Ab              Bb
And the faces are still burning
        Cm                 Dm7add11
And the mothers with their children
      Eb/Bb            F
Search     for the rain
 
 </mdiv></section>
<section type="Verse 2"><mdiv>
Fm/C                       Abmaj7/C  C      C7
Drifting through the plains        before us
Eb/Bb                Gm/Bb  F            Fsus2
As   it turns to dust     before our eyes
Fm/C              Abmaj7/C   C      C7
Pleading for a God        to pour us
       Eb/Bb             Gm/Bb        F        Fsus2
Just a little bit of rain     from an empty sky

<section type="Chorus"><mdiv>
        Fm              Gm
And the planet is still turning
        Ab              Bb
And the faces are still burning
        Cm                 Dm7add11
And the mothers with their children
      Eb/Bb
Search     for the rain

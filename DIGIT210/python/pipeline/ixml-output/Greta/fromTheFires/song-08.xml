Em        D                  Bm C
  Did you know there was a tower
           Em              D
Where they look out to the land
                  Bm              C
To see the people quickly passing by
Em        D                 Bm C
  This is for their own desire
        Em               D
As they spit down to the earth
To feel the power
Bm               C
Boiling in their veins

 And the black smoke rises
G         D                C
 From the fires we've been told
G         D          C
 It's the new age crisis
G            D               C
 And we will stand up in the cold
                Em
Stand up in the cold

Em     D              Bm  C
  Many people are dividing
      Em
And a world apart
     D
With just one heart
            Bm             C
Is bound to keel and fade away
Em        D              Bm  C
  None of us will be deciding
        Em             D
And the fate of man is in the hands
          Bm                   C
Of he who stands and heeds the call

Stand up in the cold

Fm   Eb              Bb
  Oh mama you lie in ruin
Fm          Eb                  Bb
  Can't you see what you've done
     Fm  Eb          Bb
Well I've been there before
Fm            Eb              Bb
  What's this war that you won
Fm   Eb                 Bb
  Oh mama you walk this way
Fm        Eb           Bb
  And I'm crying inside
     Fm  Eb            Bb
Well I've been there before
Fm        Eb                 Bb Fm Eb Db
  And you know that it's time

<section type="Pre-Chorus"><mdiv>
    Eb          Fm Eb  Db
And everybody's talking

That's there's talking on the street
Db             Ab
  Remember the days
             Eb/Bb           Db
When there's no one to defeat
Db          Ab
  Follow me down
       Eb/Bb              Db
To the mountain of the sun
Db               Ab
  Forgetting the end
        Eb/Bb             Db
As your new life has begun

Fm        Eb           Bb
  And the darkness near
    Fm          Eb                 Bb
Yes everyone is looking for me and you
Fm        Eb                   Bb
  And the night's what you fear
Fm     Eb                  Bb
  Walk someone they follow us
Fm           Eb        Bb
  And you're all undone
    Fm          Eb                    Bb
Yes everyone is looking for me and you
Fm        Eb           Bb
  And the war has begun

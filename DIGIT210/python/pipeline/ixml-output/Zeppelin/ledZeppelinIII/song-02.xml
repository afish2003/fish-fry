 Bright light almost blinding
Cb5                           C
   Black night still there shining
Am/C                          C
    I can't stop, keep on climbing
Cb5                    C(b9)
Looking for what I knew
C                           C
 Had a friend, she once told me
Cb5                            C
   You got love, you ain't lonely
Am/C                             C
    Now she's gone and left me only
Cb5                    C(b9)
Looking for what I knew

 Mmm, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy just

 Met a man on the roadside crying
Cb5                                 C
   Without a friend, there's no denying
Am/C                                 C
    You're incomplete, they'll be no finding
Cb5                      C(b9)
Looking for what you knew
C                         C
 So anytime somebody needs you
Cb5                                        C
   Don't let them down, although it grieves you
Am/C                                      C
    Some day you'll need someone like they do
Cb5                      C(b9)
Looking for what you knew

F#
walk down the highway
        E          B7
All I do is sing a song
      F#
And a train that's passin' my way
      E                B7
Helps rhythm move along
F#                              E

  Just simple guy
E                   B7
Live from day to day
  F#
A ray of sunshine melts my frown
E                  B7
Blows my blues away
F#
Nothin' more that I can say
         E
But on a day like today
         B7
Pass the time away
    A                      F# E F# E F#
And walk a quiet mile with you

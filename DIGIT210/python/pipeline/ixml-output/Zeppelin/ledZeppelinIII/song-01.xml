   E
We come from the land
Of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun
Where the hot springs flow.
F#m
   The hammer of the gods,
Will drive our ships to new land.
To fight the hordes,
                 A
And sing and cry.
E                    F#m
Valhalla I am coming.

We come from the land
Of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun
Where the hot springs flow.
F#m
   How soft your fields so green.
Can whisper tales of gore.
                                  A
Of how we calmed the tides of war.
E                       F#m
 We are your over Lords.

F#m
   So now you'd better stop,
And rebuild all your ruins.
For peace and trust can win the day,
                        Gm/C F#m
despite of all you're losing.
Gm/C F#m              Gm/C

F#m
   Ooh.
        Gm/C

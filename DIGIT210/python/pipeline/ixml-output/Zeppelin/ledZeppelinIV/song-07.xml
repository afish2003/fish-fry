G
Spent my days with a woman unkind
                          D
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
G
Made up my mind make a new start
                                   D
Going To California with an aching in my heart.
G
Someone told me there's a girl out there
                                 D
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.

G
Took my chances on a big jet plane
                                                  D
Never let them tell you that they're all the same.
    G
The sea was red and the sky was grey
                                    D
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
G
Mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
                                   D
Children of the sun began to awake.
Watch out

Dm
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
                   A
I think I might be sinking.
Dm
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
Meet you up there where the path
                  A
Runs straight and high.

D   G
 To find a queen without a king;
                                       D
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings.
La la la la
G
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
                                                D
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born.
G
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
                                           D
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems

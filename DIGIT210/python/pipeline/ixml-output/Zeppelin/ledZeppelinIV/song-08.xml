      F5
If it keeps on raining
Levee's going to break
If it keeps on raining
Levee's going to break
When the levee breaks
We'll have no place to stay
Mean old levee
Taught me to weep and moan, oh
Mean old levee
Taught me to weep and moan
It's got what it takes
To make a mountain man leave his home
Oh well, oh well, oh well, ooh

Crying won't help you
Praying won't do you no good
No, crying won't help you
Praying won't do you no good
When the levee breaks
Mama, you got to move, ooh
All last night
I sat on the levee and moaned
All last night
Sat on the levee and moaned
Thinking about my baby
And my happy home
Ohho

In the days of my youth, I was told What it means
            E
to be a man.
D A/C#    E                                         D
      And now I've reached that age I've tried to do
          A/C#             E
All those things the best I can

F#m
Sixteen I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be.
It only took a couple of days 'till she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me 'till the end,
But when I whispered in her ear I lost another friend. Oh!

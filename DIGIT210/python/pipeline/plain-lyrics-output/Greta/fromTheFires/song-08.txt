[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Did you know there was a tower
Where they look out to the land
To see the people quickly passing by
This is for their own desire
As they spit down to the earth To feel the power
Boiling in their veins

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
And the black smoke rises
From the fires we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
Stand up in the cold

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Many people are dividing
And a world apart
With just one heart
Is bound to keel and fade away
None of us will be deciding
And the fate of man is in the hands
Of he who stands and heeds the call

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
And the black smoke rises
From the fires we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
Stand up in the cold

[Break]
Stand up in the cold
We won't stand

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
And the black smoke rises
From the fires we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
And the black smoke rises
From the fires we've been told
It's the new age crisis
And we will stand up in the cold
Stand up in the cold

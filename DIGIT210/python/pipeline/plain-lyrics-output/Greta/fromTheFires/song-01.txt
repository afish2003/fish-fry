Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh lady won't you come on down, won't you come on down I said
my town
Oh mama won't you come on down, won't you come on down
I said to my home
Oh lady won't you move my way, can't you move my way I'm getting
hazy
Oh mama when you give your love, when you give your love You drive me
crazy

[Chorus]
Oh mama
What you gonna do with all that love in your heart
Oh mama

Oh mama
When you walk this way why don't you give some lovin'
Oh mama
What you gonna do with all that love in your heart

[Post-Chorus]

[Verse 2]
See mama I gonna feel your everything, I feel your everything
I really wanna know
See mama when you shine you're shining bright, give your giving light
I really want your love to glow
See mama when your heart is in its place, see that smiling face
Is all I wanna do
See mama every time that you won't here, it's when you're gonna be
You never wanna come back home

[Chorus]
Oh mama

Oh mama
When you walk this way why don't you give some lovin'
Oh mama

[Bridge]
Do you remember what I said when I got down on my knees?
Gotta get your lovin' baby, your lovin's all I need Don't make me beg now baby, don't make me bleed I gave you
all a man could give and you still walked out on me

[Chorus]
Oh mama
What you gonna do with all that love in your heart
Oh mama
What you gotta say about that love in your heart
Oh mama
When you walk this way why don't you give some lovin'
Oh mama
What you gonna do with all that love in your heart

[Outro]
Your heart
Your heart
Your heart
Your heart
Lovin', burning fire
Oh yeah

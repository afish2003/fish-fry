[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I was born by the river In a little tent
And just like river, baby
I've been running ever since
It's been a long

[Chorus]
Long time coming And I know
Change is gonna come

[Verse 2]
It's been too hard living But I'm afraid to die
Cause I don't know what's up there, baby
Beyond the sky
It's been a long

[Chorus]
Long time coming And I know
Change is gonna come

[Bridge]
Well, I go down to my brother
And I say Brother, help me please,
But he winds up
Knocking me back down
On my knees

[Verse 3]
There'd been times where I thought I Couldn't last for long
Now I think I'm able
To carry on
It's been a long

[Chorus]
Long time coming And I know
Change is gonna come
Oh, yes it will It's been a long
Long time coming And I know
Change gonna come Well, it's been a long
Long time coming And I know

[Outro]

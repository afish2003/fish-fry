[Intro]

[Bridge 1]

[Verse 1]
Every day's a new day
Every way's a new way
On the edge of darkness
Finding out what it means to love

[Pre-Chorus]
And to think we've found the time

[Chorus]
All my brothers we stand
For the peace of the land
Is there meaning
I've got love in my heart
For an army apart
I am bleeding
All my brothers we stand
For the peace of the land
Is there meaning
I've got love in my heart
For an army apart
I am bleeding

[Bridge 2]

[Verse 2]
Always searching for love
Always searching for light
What the world is made of
When I'm thinking it's right

[Pre-Chorus]
And to think we've found the time

[Chorus]
All my brothers we stand
For the peace of the land
Is there meaning
I've got love in my heart
For an army apart
I am bleeding
All my brothers we stand
For the peace of the land
Is there meaning
I've got love in my heart
For an army apart
I am bleeding

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I've got love in my heart
For an army apart
I am bleeding
All my brothers we stand
For the peace of the land
Is there meaning
I've got love in my heart
For an army apart
I am bleeding

[Outro]
I'am bleeding

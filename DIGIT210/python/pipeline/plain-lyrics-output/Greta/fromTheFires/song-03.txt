[Intro]

[Verse 1]
She is a lady, comes from all around
She's many places, but she's homeward bound
And now she walks kinda funny I think she knows
Day by day by day Our love grows
She's a lantern in the night She's outta sight

[Pre-Chorus]
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma Ma ma

[Chorus]
Turn tonight, firelight
Star shines in her eye
Makes me feel like I'm alive
She's outta sight, yeah
Aw yeah
She's alright, she's alright, she's alright
She's outta sight, outta sight

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Electric gold our love with tender care
Hills of satin grass and maidens fair
Now she rides through the night On a silver storm
Sword in hand Our fate's torn
She's a sparrow of the dawn Our love is born

[Pre-Chorus]
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma Ma ma

[Chorus]
Turn tonight, firelight
Star shines in her eye
Makes me feel like I'm alive
She's outta sight, yeah
Aw yeah
She's alright, she's alright, she's alright
She's outta sight, outta sight

[Solo]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah Oh yeah
Oh yeah papapa
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
As the days pass by my mind
Are the wrong, the right
You are my sunshine
And as the night begins to die
We are the morning birds that sing against the sky

[Interlude]

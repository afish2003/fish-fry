[Intro]

[Pre-Verse]

[Verse 1]
Babe, ain't no denying
That I've got you in my head
Girl, I'd be flying
If you stood yourself and said

[Chorus]
You're the one I want
You're the one I need
You're the one I had
So come on back to me

[Pre-Verse]

[Verse 2]
Babe, you're so young and pretty
But you're evil, you oughta know
Darling, ain't that a pity
Won't you stand yourself and show

[Chorus]
You're the one I want
You're the one I need
You're the one I had
So come on back to me

[Organ Solo]

[Verse 3]
See, where we've been
Won't you hold my hand and stay awhile

[Chorus]
You're the one I want
You're the one I need
You're the one I had
So come on back to me
You're the one I want
You're the one I need
You're the one I, you're the one I had
So come on back to me

[Guitar Solo]
Yeah, come on baby

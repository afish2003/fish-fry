[Intro]

[Main Riff]

[Verse 1]
Well you're so great and I love you so You know I'm your biggest fan I saw your picture and it's the best The finest in the land
Camera lights and action
And words you know so well
You're in and out of fashion
In Hollywood of hell

[Chorus]
When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all

[Verse 2]
Well I love you in that movie show Can I have your autograph It's so funny you have such charm And whole thing made me laugh
Obetral and cocktails
You're counting all your rings
They all said they loved you
(Didn't they darlin')
Well they've taken all your things

[Chorus]
When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all

[Bridge]
Well listen darlin'
It's been real swell
What can I say You've got it all
You're a one woman show
But I'm not gonna' lie
You could use a little work
Well at your age

[Guitar Solo]
What've you got baby

[Chorus]
When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all

[Outro]
Goodbye baby, goodbye

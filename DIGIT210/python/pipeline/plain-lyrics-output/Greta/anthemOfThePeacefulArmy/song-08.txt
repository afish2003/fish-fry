[Intro]

[Verse 1]
The sun shines brighter from above
And you're the woman that I love
Climb the mountain even higher
To kiss the sun and fight the fire

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh well

[Chorus]
I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine
I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine

[Verse 2]
Take me with you when you go
To be with you is all I know
As we ride, we light the fire
The second sun's our love's desire

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh well

[Chorus]
I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine
I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh well

[Verse 3]
The sun shines brighter from above And you're the woman that I love We climb the mountain even higher Kiss the sun, fight the fire

[Chorus]
I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine
I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine

[Intro]
In an age of darkness
Light appears
And it wards away The
ancient fears
March to the anthem
Of the heart
To a brand new day, A
brand new start

[Pre-Verse]
Uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
To wonderlands of
Ice and snow
In the desert heat Where
nothing grows
A tree of life In
rain and sun
To reach the sky It's
just begun

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, uh Uh, uh, uh

[Chorus]
And as we came
Into the clear
To find ourselves
Where we are here
Who is the wiser
To help us steer?
And will we know
When the end is near?
Uh, uh Uh, uh

[Pre-Verse]

[Verse 2]
A beauty lives In
every soul
The more you love The
more you know
They pass the torch And
it still burns
Once children then It's
now our turn

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, uh Uh, uh, uh

[Chorus]
And as we came
Into the clear
To find ourselves
Where we are here
Who is the wiser
To help us steer?
And will we know
When the end is near?

[Bridge]
La, la, la, la La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

[Chorus]
And as we came
Into the clear
To find ourselves
Where we are here
Who is the wiser
To help us steer?
And will we know
When the end is near?

[Outro]
Ah, ah
Ah, ah

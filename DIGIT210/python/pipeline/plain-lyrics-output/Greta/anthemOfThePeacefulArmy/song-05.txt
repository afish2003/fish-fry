[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh my holy lord Sets my soul on fire Flames of love and sweet perfume
She's my heart's desire
She's an angel straight from hell Draws me to the deep In the darkness way below
It's my heart she'll keep

[Verse 2]
Thunder underground Watch the castle fall Sound of wind it takes the sky
Winter takes us all Mountain high against the sky Watches as we pray Laughing out and smiling proud
This is where we lay Lover

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Interlude]

[Main Riff]

[Verse 3]
All night hellfire Erase your memories So he'll fall to his knees
Watch the fire blaze Satan plays flute for him The sound it burns his ears Watch his eyes His piece of mind

[Chorus]
Slips and disappears Lover Leaver Taker Believer

[Outro]

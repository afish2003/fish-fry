[Intro]

[Verse 1]
We have shared with you our stories
Had ourselves a really big time
Fought in battles far from the homeland
Made love, even drank from the wine

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
And I wish we all could stay
But I bid you a farewell
And it means the world to play
But I bid you a farewell

[Verse 2]
Friends how've come so far to join us
We hope you come and join us again
Friends how've come to sing in the chorus
You floor us, we will sing till the end

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
And I wish we all could stay
But I bid you a farewell
And it means the world to play
But I bid you a farewell

[Bridge]

[Solo Guitar]

[Chorus]
And I wish we all could stay
But I bid you a farewell
And it means the world to play
But I bid you a farewell

[Outro]
We gathered here tonight
Did it up just right And
it's all for you
We gathered here tonight
Did it up just right
And it's all for you
We gathered here tonight
Did it up just right

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Vengeance is a bow
And arrows only justice when fired
I have loved I have lost
I am the archer!
Devil at the door
Standing with his right arm extended
On a hunt For the kill
I am the archer!

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Torn I turn to my bow, Sara!
Torn I turn to my arrow, Sara!

[Verse 2]
Final blow
My heaviness of breath has been lifted
Let the world know my name
I am the archer!

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Torn I turn to my bow, Sara!
Torn I turn to my arrow, Sara!

[Bridge]
My home is on the horse I ride What emptiness without my bride Such heaviness inside This was the day the archer died

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Torn I turn to my bow, Sara!
Torn I turn to my arrow, Sara!
Torn I turn to my bow, Sara!
Torn I turn to my arrow, Sara!

[Outro]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Frozen light like falling snow
Here to guide us the long way home
The streets are silent
The moonlight is dancing
Four brothers searching for a meal

[Pre-Chorus]
I know, that I am not alone
I know, the frozen light will take me there

[Chorus]
Cast a light to lead the ride on
A flame for going home
Cast a light to burn the night down
A flame for going home

[Break]

[Verse 2]
Frosty bite for searching souls
Drunken laughter and dreams and gold
Anticipation, the distance is dancing
The smell of something in the air

[Pre-Chorus]
I know, that I am not alone
I know, the chosen road is ours to bear
I know, that I am not alone
I know, the frozen light will guide me there

[Chorus]
Cast a light to lead the ride on
A flame for going home
Cast a light to burn the night down
A flame for going home

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Cast a light to lead the ride on
A flame for going home
Cast a light to burn the night down
A flame for going home

Album: Starcatcher

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
What a day to meet the master
I've been waiting for so long
Final day to meet the master
It's my time to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm taken
By the mad_________ness
And the tripping
And the tou___ching_

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
What a day to travel faster
Take my trip around the sun
I have known no other master
He has been the only one

[Bridge]
Ooh, he was the only one
Ooh, only one

[Chorus]
And I'm taken
By the mad_________ness
And the tripping
And the tou___ching_

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Blow it up
To give him
All of our love
All of our love
Blow it up
To give him
All of our love
All of our love
Blow it up
To give him
All of our love
All of our love

[Outro]
All of our love
All of our love
All of our love
All of our love

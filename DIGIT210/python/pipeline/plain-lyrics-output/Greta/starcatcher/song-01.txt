[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hail, the God song!
All trill to the tune devout reprise!
Hail, the eon!
We nelt on this slab the blessed people!

[Chorus]
We fought for the fable, aha!
But instead we burn
And in the end of time, aha!
Left an empty urn

[Break]

[Verse 2]
Hail, the maker!
A noisy device to take the toll!
God forsake her!
For the songs that she sang have left god's acre!

[Break]

[Chorus]
We fought for the fable, aha!
But instead we burn
And in the end of time, aha!
Left an empty urn

[Break]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
We fought for the fable, aha!
But instead we burn
And in the end of time, aha!
Left an empty urn

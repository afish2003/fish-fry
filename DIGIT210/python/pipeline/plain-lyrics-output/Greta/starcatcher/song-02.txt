[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Let's begin!
You've wondered through the door
Come on in
Have you been here before?

[Pre-Chorus]
Waited all your life!

[Chorus]
You've come from so far away!
And do you intend to stay?
Swim to shore
If this is what you're looking for
Shout, Oh Lord!
If this is what your looking for
You've been on your way
You've been on your way
Please stay

[Verse 2]
Where've you been
We won't lead you astray
Share our skin
It's time for us to pray Pray!

[Pre-Chorus]
Waited all your life!

[Chorus]
You've come from so far away!
And do you intend to stay?
Swim to shore
If this is what you're looking for
Shout, Oh Lord!
If this is what your looking for
You've been on your way
You've been on your way

[Bridge]
Please stay

[Chorus]
You've come from so far away!
And do you intend to stay?
Swim to shore
If this is what you're looking for
Shout, Oh Lord!
If this is what your looking for
You've been on your way
You've been on your way
Way, way, way, way, way, way

[Guitar Solo]
Don't run away...
Swim to shore
Please stay, please stay, please stay

[Outro]
Please stay
Don't go away

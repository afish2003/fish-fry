[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've been handed a quite demanding and hardly standing lie to tell Life is sorted and never thwarted it's just supported by being well
I don't want to loose this time
I just want to let it pass

[Chorus]
Holding up the falling sky
Holding up the falling sky

[Verse 2]
Here's the trouble with seeing double it's torn down rubble that's left behind You can live with a pointless forte that silly board game that you would know
I don't want to loose this time
I just want to let it pass

[Chorus]
Holding up the falling sky
Holding up the falling sky

[Bridge]

[Solo Harmonica]

[Chorus]
Holding up the falling sky
Holding up the falling sky
Holding up the falling sky

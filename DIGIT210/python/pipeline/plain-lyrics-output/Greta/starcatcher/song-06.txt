[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Wide minded dreamer From far and away Paints pictures cleaner
With brushes he touches the sky

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
No child to woman But child no less Though mostly human The painter a prophet so high

[Chorus]
Into the ether
Ready for the gar den
Into it deeper
Even heavens hearken Rea
ching, reaching, reaching

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Seen over sundown Catching the stars Above, the cyclone The Indigo streak that becomes the eye

[Chorus]
Into the ether
Ready for the garden
Into it deeper
Even heavens hearken Rea
ching, reaching, reaching

[Interlude]
Bm/E A#add(b5) D B7

[Solo]
Esus2 Bm/E A#add(b5) D

[Chorus]
Into the ether
Ready for the garden
Into it deeper
Even heavens hearken
Into the ether
Ready for the garden
Into it deeper
Even heavens hearken Reach
ing, reach
ing,
reaching

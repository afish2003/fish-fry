[Intro]

[Verse 1]
The sequins tripping on the light Woah
I feel it hugging me so tight Woah

[Pre-Chorus]
I've seen it in the stars
To dress up a wound, heal a scar

[Chorus]
I've caught the wind in a kite of dreams
In a flight of seams
Like freedom sewn
And the people roar
And the people soar
Sacred the thread
Sacred the thread
I've caught the wind in a kite of dreams
In a flight of seams

[Pre-Verse]

[Verse 2]
I see me
Through colours gems and trim Woah
The glow that was once dim Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I've seen it in the stars
To dress up a wound, heal a scar

[Chorus]
I've caught the wind in a kite of dreams
In a flight of seams
Like freedom sewn
And the people roar
And the people soar
Sacred the thread
Sacred the thread
I've caught the wind in a kite of dreams
In a flight of seams

[Interlude]
Woah woah woah woah
Woah woah woah woah

[Chorus]
I've caught the wind in a kite of dreams
In a flight of seams
Like freedom sewn
And the people roar
And the people soar
Sacred the thread
Sacred the thread
I've caught the wind in a kite of dreams
In a flight of seams

[Solo]
Sacred the thread
Sacred the thread
I've caught the wind in a kite of dreams
In a flight of seams

[Outro]

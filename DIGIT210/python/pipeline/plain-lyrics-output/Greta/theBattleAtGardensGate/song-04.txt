[Intro]

[Verse 1]
When a man must walk the Devil's road oh
Churning up the earth below
He is bound to brothers built by na tions
With no pride to call his own

[Chorus]
Whoa, the trouble gets so loud
When all of Hell tries to drag you down
Whoa, the wounded warrior
whoa, on this battleground

[Verse 2]
Who is he to think of his survi val
When a man must kill his home?
Standing naked in the breast of ca nyons
Where companions are alone

[Chorus]
Whoa, the trouble gets so loud
When all of Hell tries to drag you down
Whoa, the wounded warrior
whoa, on this battleground

[Bridge]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Whoa, the trouble gets so loud
Gets so loud
Whoa, the wounded warrior

[Outro]

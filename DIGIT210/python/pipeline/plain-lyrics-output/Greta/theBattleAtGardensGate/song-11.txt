[Verse 1]
Enter the flow
Dharma, Divine
Succeeding signs
Carbon dancing through time
Give me the truth, and I will sing on
My universe is so
To ask the questions unknown
Is to respond
Ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram

[Chorus]
To comet across the blistering hue
Beyond the spaces of false and true
Away from the world we have riddled with scars
To be wholly free and amongst the stars

[Verse 2]
You are the land
The sea and the sky, woah
The explanation why
We're tied to all things as one
Rhythm of space
Expansion of soul
A force beyond control
Travelers in time searching for the unknown
Ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram, ram

[Chorus]
To comet across the blistering hue
Beyond the spaces of false and true
Away from the world we have riddled with scars
To be wholly free and amongst the stars

[Instrumental]
Ah sri rama, jayam, ram ram ram ram
Ah sri rama, jayam, ram ram ram ram

[Chorus]
To comet across the blistering hue
Beyond the spaces of false and true
Away from the world we have riddled with scars
To be wholly free and amongst the stars

[Outro]
Yeah, Hey

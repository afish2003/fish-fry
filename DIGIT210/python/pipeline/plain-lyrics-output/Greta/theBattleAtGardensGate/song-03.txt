[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can see the faces through the broken glass
No longer pass
Looking at the sky, I see the city lights
But no star fights

[Pre-Chorus]
I never want to fall asleep
Within my dreams, the weight we sow, we reap
Though I believe the sun still shines
And I believe there comes a time

[Chorus]
When out of silence, we will sing
And even broken bells will ring
Not all the answers are the same
Yet we still play the game

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Sweeping off the pavement with a parlor broom
Going nowhere soon
Between the cracks of sidewalk, there's a flower grown
Beyond the stone

[Pre-Chorus]
I never want to fall asleep
Within my dreams, the weight we sow, we reap
Though I believe the sun still shines
And I believe there comes a time

[Chorus]
When out of silence, we will sing
And even broken bells will ring
Not all the answers are the same
Yet we still play the game
Yet we still play the game

[Interlude 1]

[Interlude 2]
Oh...

[Solo]

[Chorus]
When out of silence, we will sing
And even broken bells will ring
Not all the answers are the same
Yet we still play the game

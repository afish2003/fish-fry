[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Sorrows of the Earth
May our tears of rain wash down to bathe you
This is what life is worth When the fires still burn and rage all around
Can you hear that dreadful sound?
Fire still burning on the ground

[Verse 2]
Follow the fearsome sound As they march to battle, hear the drums pound
We do not fight for war But to save the lives of those who do so
Can you hear that dreadful sound?
Fire still burning on the ground

[Chorus]
Can you feel my love?
Rising with the heat above
Life's the story of
Ascending to the stars as one

[Verse 3]
Marching across the land Is a peaceful army joining the band
Walking hand in hand
To an anthem loudly sung where they stand
Can you hear that dreadful sound?
Fire still burning on the ground

[Break]
Lalala lalala la
Lalala lalala la

[Chorus]
Can you feel my love?
Rising with the heat above
Life's the story of
Ascending to the stars as one

[Break]

[Outro]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Bathing in the light around us
Praying for the night to comfort thee
Dancing on the coals below us
Praying for the flood to set us free

[Chorus]
And the planet is still turning
And the faces are still burning
And the mothers with their children
Search for the rain

[Verse 2]
Drifting through the plains before us
As it turns to dust before our eyes
Pleading for a God to pour us
Just a little bit of rain from an empty sky

[Chorus]
And the planet is still turning
And the faces are still burning
And the mothers with their children
Search for the rain

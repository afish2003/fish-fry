Birthright of death with a fiery breath
Funeral of innocense, oh-whoa
Painted up in the red and dressed in lead, we are

Well, I've done my time, whoa-oh
Behold visions of burning skies
Alas Babylon, whoa, whoa, whoa

Mothers of barbarians, oh-whoa
Were your young so spry when they left to die? We are

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Are we prisoners or renegades?
Well, I've done my time, whoa-oh
Behold visions of burning skies
Alas Babylon, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Chorus]
Are we prisoners or renegades?
Well, I've done my time, whoa-oh
Behold visions of burning skies
Alas Babylon, whoa, whoa, whoa

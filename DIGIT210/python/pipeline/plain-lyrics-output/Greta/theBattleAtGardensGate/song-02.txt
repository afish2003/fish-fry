[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've seen many people
There are so many people
Some are much younger people
And some are so old
I've seen many places
There are so many places
And where are the people going?
Will they choose the road?

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
I've packed my bags and I've got my freedom
I've sacked the rules so I don't have to heed them
I'll bet on a chance if I've just got one
I'll throw out the plans and live with no burden

[Post-Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I have but a lifetime
Seems so long but it flies by
And in the moments passing
I'll bear no load
I have yet to wander
Many miles far yonder
And with so much left to ponder
I choose the road

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
I've packed my bags and I've got my freedom
I've sacked the rules so I don't have to heed them
I'll bet on a chance if I've just got one
I'll throw out the plans and live with no burden

[Interlude]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
I've packed my bags and I've got my freedom
I've sacked the rules so I don't have to heed them
I'll bet on a chance if I've just got one
I'll throw out the plans and live with no burden

[Outro]

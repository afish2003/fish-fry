[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Leaves are falling all around. Time I was on my way.
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay, But
now it's time for me to go.
The autumn moon lights my way.
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way.
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired, but I know one thing I got to do.

[Chorus]
Ramble on.
And now's the time, the time is now.
Sing my song.
I'm goin' 'round the world, I got to find my girl.
On my way.
I've been this way ten years to the day.
Ramble on.
To find the queen of all my dreams.

[Verse 2]
Got no time for spreadin' roots. The time has come to be gone.
And to our health we drank a thousand times, it's time to ramble on.

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Ramble on.
And now's the time, the time is now.
Sing my song.
I'm goin' 'round the world, I got to find my girl.
On my way.
I've been this way ten years to the day. I've got to
Ramble on.
I've got to find the queen of all my dreams.
I tell you no lies.

[Verse 3]
Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear.
How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air. T'was in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair.
But Gollum and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her, her, her, yeah. And there's nothing I can do no.
I guess I'll keep on

[Chorus]
Rambling.
I'm gonna sing yeah. I gotta find my baby.
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song, gonna work my way, go around the world.
Baby, baby.
A do, do, do, do, do my baby.
A do, do do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do babe.
Gonna keep searching for my baby.

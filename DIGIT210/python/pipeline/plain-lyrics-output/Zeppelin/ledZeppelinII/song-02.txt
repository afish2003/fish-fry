[Intro]
And if I say to you tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Take my hand, child come with me
It's to a castle I will take you
Where what's to be, they say will be

[Chorus]
Catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away leave today
Way up high in the sky, hey, whoa But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show That you will be mine
By takin' our time, ooh
And if you say to me tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Oh what fun it all would be
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby
But what is and what should never be

[Chorus]
Catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away leave today
Way up high in the sky, hey, whoa But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show That you will be mine
By takin' our time, ooh

[Solo]
So if you wake up with the sunrise

[Verse 3]
And all your dreams are still as new
And happiness is what you need so bad
Girl, the answer lies with you, yeah

[Chorus]
Catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away leave today
Way up high in the sky But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show That you will be mine
By takin' our time

[Interlude]
Oh the wind won't blow and we really shouldn't go And it only goes to showowow My yeah oh Everybody I know seems to know me well But does anybody know I'm gonna move like hell Oh yeah yeah baby

[Outro (Fade Out)]
Do do do, bop bop a dooh Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, yeah

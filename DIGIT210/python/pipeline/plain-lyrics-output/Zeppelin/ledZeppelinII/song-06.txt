Album: Led Zeppelin II
Artist: Led Zeppelin
Key: A

[Verse 1]
With a purple umberella and a fifty cent hat
Missus cool rides out in her aged Cadillac

[Chorus]
Come on babe on the roundabout ride on the merry go round
We all know what your name is so you better lay your money down

[Verse 2]
Alimony alimony payin' your bills
When your conscience hits you knock it back with pills

[Chorus]
Come on babe on the roundabout ride on the merry goround
We all know what your name is so you better lay your money down

[Verse 3]
Tellin' tall tales of how it used to be
With the butler and the maid and the servants three
Ah get it now She's a woman

[Solo]
Oh you got

[Verse 4]
Nobody hears a single word you say
But you keep on talkin' till your dyin' day

[Chorus]
Come on babe on the roundabout ride on the merry goround
We all know what your name is so you better lay your money down

[Outro]
Livin' livin' lovin' lovin' she's just a woman
Lu lu lu lu lu lu lu lu lu lu lu

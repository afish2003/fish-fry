[Intro]

[Verse 1]
In the days of my youth, I was told What it means
to be a man.
And now I've reached that age I've tried to do
All those things the best I can
No matter how I try I find my way into the same old jam.

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share.
Well, my woman left home for a brown eyed man,
But I still don't seem to care.

[Verse 2]
Sixteen I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be. It only took a couple of days 'till she was rid of me She swore that she would be all mine and love me 'till the end, But when I whispered in her ear I lost another friend. Oh!

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share.
Well, my woman left home for a brown eyed man,
But I still don't seem to care.

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share.
Well, my woman left home for a browneyed man, but I still don't seem to care.

[Verse 3]
I know what it means to be alone,
I sure do wish I was at home.
I don't care what the neighbors say,
I'm gonna love you each and ev'ry day.

[Outro]
You can feel the beat within my heart.
Realize sweet babe we ain't never gonna part.

Album: Led Zeppelin
Artist: Led Zeppelin

[Verse 1]
Oh , I can't quit you , baby
So I'm gonna put you down for awhile
I said I can't quit you, baby
I guess I'm gotta put you down for awhile
Said you messed up my happy horme
Made me mistreat my only child

[Bridge]
Yes sir you did!

[Verse 2]
Said you know I love you, baby
My love for you I could never hide
Oh, you know I love you, baby
My love for you I could never hide
Oh, when I feel you near me, little girl
I know you are my one desire

[Bridge]

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
When you hear me moaning and groaning, baby
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh , when you hear me moaning and groaning, baby
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh oh, when you hear me holler, baby
You know you're my one desire

[Outro]
Yes, you are
Oh .

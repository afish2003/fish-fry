I was a young man, I couldn't resist Started thinking it over, just what I had missed Got me a girl and I kissed her and then and then Whoops, oh no, yeah, well I did it again
Now I' got ten children of my own
I got another child on the way, that makes eleven
But I'm in constant heaven
I know it's all right in my mind
'Cause I got a little schoolgirl and she's all mine
I can't get through to her cause it doesn't permit
But I'm gonna give her everything I've got to give

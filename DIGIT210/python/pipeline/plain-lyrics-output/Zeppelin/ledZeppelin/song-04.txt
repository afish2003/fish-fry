[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true.
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you.
Lots of people talking, few of them know.
Soul of a woman was created below.

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
You hurt and abused, tellin' all of your lies.
Run around sweet baby, lord how they hypnotize.
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you've been.
Gonna love you baby, here I come again.

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Every day I work so hard, bringin' home my hard earned pay.
Struggle over you baby, but you push me away.
Don't know where you're goin', only know just where you've been.
Sweet little baby, I want you again.

[Interlude]

[Solo]

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true.
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you.
Take it easy baby, let them say what they will.
Tongue wag so much when I send you the bill?

[Outro]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hey girl, stop what you're doin'.
Hey, girl, you'll drive me to ruin.
I don't know what it is that I like about you, but I like it a lot.
Won't you let me hold you? Let me feel your lovin' charms.

[Chorus]
Com munication breakdown,
It's always the same. Having a nervous breakdown, Drive me insane.

[Verse 2]
Hey girl, I got something I think you ought to know.
Hey babe, I wanna tell you that I love you so.
I wanna hold you in my arms, yeah.
I'm never gonna let you go,
'Cause I like your charms.

[Chorus]
Com munication breakdown,
It's always the same. Having a nervous breakdown,
Drive me insane.

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Com munication breakdown,
It's always the same. Having a nervous breakdown,
Drive me insane
I want you to love me all night
I want you to love me all night
Whoa, ah, a whoa oh
I want you to love me
I want you to love

[Fade Out]
I want you to love, yeah I want you
to love, yeah I want you
to love, yeah

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since I rock and Rolled It's been a long time since I did the Stroll
Ooh let me get it back let me get it back
Let me get it back, baby, where I come from
It's been a long time been a long time
Been a long lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely time Yes it has

[Verse 2]
It's been a long time since The Book of Love I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back carry me back
Carry me back baby where I come from
It's been a long time been a long time
Been a long lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely time

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight Making vows that just can't work right
Open your arms opens your arms
Open your arms baby let my love come running in
It's been a long time been a long time
Been a long lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely time

[Instrumental]
It's been a long time been a long time
Been a long lonely lonely lonely lonely

It's been too long 'fore I found out, what people mean by down and out. Spent my money, took my car, started telling her friends she gon' be a star. I don't know, but I've been told,
a biglegged woman ain't got no soul.

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, oh.

All I ask for, all I pray steady rolling woman 'gonna come my way. Need a woman who's gonna hold my hand, won't tell me no lies, make me a happy man. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

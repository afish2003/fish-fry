[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh baby it's cryin' time Oh baby I got to fly
Got to try to find a way
Got to try to get away
'Cause you know I gotta get away from you babe

[Verse 2]
Oh baby the river's red, ah baby in my head
There's a funny feelin' goin' on
I don't think I can hold out long

[Chorus]
And when the owls cry in the night
Oh baby, baby when the pines begin to cry Baby, baby, baby how do you feel?
If the river runs dry, baby, how do you feel?

[Riff]

[Verse 3]
Craze, baby, the rainbow's end, mmm, baby, it's just a den
For those who hide, hide their love to depths of life
And ruin dreams that we all knew so, babe

[Chorus]
And when the owls cry in the night
Oh baby when the pines begin to cry Oh baby, baby, how do you feel?
If the river runs dry, baby, how do you feel?

[Bridge]
Baby how do you feel?

[Verse 4]
Ooh yeah, brave I endure Ooh yeah, strong shields and lore
They can't hold the wrath of those who walk
An' the boots of those who march
Baby, through the roads of time so long ago

[Fade Out]

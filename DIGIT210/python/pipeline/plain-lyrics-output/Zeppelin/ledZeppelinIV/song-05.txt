[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Walkin' in the park just the other day, baby
What do you what do you think I saw?
Crowds of people sittin' on the grass with flowers in their hair said
Hey Boy do you want to score?

[Bridge]
And you know how it is I really don't know what time it was oh, oh
So I asked them if I could stay awhile

[Verse 2]
I didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really
Really out of my mind.
Just then a policeman stepped up to me and asked us said
Please, hey, would we care to all get in line Get in line
Well you know

[Bridge]
They asked us to stay for tea and have some fun
Oh, oh, he said that his friends would all drop by, oh

[Verse 3]
Why don't you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see
And baby, baby, baby, do you like it?
There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rustin'
Ah, not trying to fight it

[Bridge]
You really don't care if they're coming oh, oh
I know that it's all a state of mind, oh.

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
If you go down in the streets today, Baby, you better
You better o_pen your eyes
Folk down there really don't care, really don't care
Don't care, really don't Which, which
way the pressure lies
So I've decided what I'm gonna do now

[Bridge]
So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains
Where the spirits go now
Over the hills where the spirits fly

[Outro (Fade Out)]
I really dont know
I really dont know

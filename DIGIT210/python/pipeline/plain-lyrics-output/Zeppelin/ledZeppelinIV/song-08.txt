[Intro]

[Break]

[Verse 1]
If it keeps on raining Levee's going to break If it keeps on raining Levee's going to break When the levee breaks We'll have no place to stay Mean old levee Taught me to weep and moan, oh Mean old levee Taught me to weep and moan It's got what it takes To make a mountain man leave his home Oh well, oh well, oh well, ooh

[Break]

[Bridge]
Oh don't it make you feel bad

[Chorus]
When you're trying to find your way home
You don't know which way to go If you're going down south
They got no work to do
If you're going north to Chicago

[Harmonica Solo]

[Break]

[Verse 2]
Crying won't help you Praying won't do you no good No, crying won't help you Praying won't do you no good When the levee breaks Mama, you got to move, ooh All last night I sat on the levee and moaned All last night Sat on the levee and moaned Thinking about my baby And my happy home

[Break]

[Guitar Solo]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh

[Outro]
I'm going to Chicago Going to Chicago Sorry, but I can't take you Going down Going down now Going down I'm going down now Going down Going down Going down Going down
Going down Going down now Going down Going down now Going down Going down now Going down Going, dowdowdowdowdown now Ooh, ooh

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Measuring a summer's day
I only find it slips away to grey
The hours they bring me pain

[Chorus]
living reflection from a dream
I was her love oh she was my queen
and now a thousand years between

[Verse 2]
Thinking how it used to be
does she still remember times like these
to think of us again and i do

[Solo]

[Chorus]
living reflection from a dream I was her love
she was my queen
and now a thousand years between

[Outro]

[Intro]
Ah, ah.

[Verse 1]
We come from the land Of the ice and snow, From the midnight sun Where the hot springs flow.
The hammer of the gods, Will drive our ships to new land. To fight the hordes,
And sing and cry.
Valhalla I am coming.

[Chorus]
On we sweep with, with threshing oars.
Our only goal will be the western shore.

[Re-Intro]
Ah, ah.

[Verse 2]
We come from the land Of the ice and snow, From the midnight sun Where the hot springs flow.
How soft your fields so green. Can whisper tales of gore.
Of how we calmed the tides of war.
We are your over Lords.

[Chorus]
On we sweep, with threshing oars.
Our only goal will be the western shore.

[Outro]
So now you'd better stop, And rebuild all your ruins. For peace and trust can win the day,
despite of all you're losing.
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.
Ooh.
Ooh Ooh.
Ah.
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.
Ooh.
Ooh. Ooh.
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

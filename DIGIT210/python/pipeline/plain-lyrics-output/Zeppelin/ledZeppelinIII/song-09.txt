[Intro]

[Riff]

[Verse 1]
Ah, caught you smiling at me, thats the way it should be, like a leaf is to a tree so fine.
Ah, all the good times we had, I sang love songs so glad, al_ways smiling, never sad so fine.

[Chorus]
As we walk down a country lane, I'll be singing a song, you'll hear me calling your name.
Hear the wind whisper in the trees telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me.

[Riff]

[Verse 2]
Well. if the sun shines so bright, or our way is darkest night, the road we choose is always right, so fine.
Ah, can a love be so strong when so many loves go wrong? Will our
love go on and on, and on, and on, and on, and on?

[Chorus]
As we walk down a country lane, while singing a song, hear me calling your name.
Hear the wind Whisper in the trees, telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me.

[Bridge]
My, my Lordy Lord come on now it ain't too far.
Tell your friends all around the world ain't no companion like a blue eyed merle.
Come on now, well let me tell you what you're missing, mes__sing 'round them brick walls.

[Interlude]

[Riff]

[Verse 3]
So of one thing I am sure, it's a friendship so pure, an_gels singing all around my door so fine.
Yeah, Ain't but one thing to do, spend my na'tral life with you, you're the finest dog I knew so fine.

[Chorus]
When you're old and your eyes are dim there ain't no Old Shep Gonna happen again.
We'll still go walking down country lanes, I'll sing the same old song, hear me call your name.

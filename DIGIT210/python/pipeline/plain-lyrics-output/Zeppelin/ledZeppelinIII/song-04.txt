[Intro 1]

[Intro 2]

[Pre-Chorus]
Workin' from seven to eleven every night
It really makes life a drag I don't think that's right

[Verse 1]
I've really been the best of fools I did what I could, yeah
'Cause I love you, baby How I love you, darling How I love you, baby My beloved little girl, little girl

[Chorus]
But baby, since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Everybody trying to tell me
That you didn't mean me no good
I've been trying, Lord, let me tell you Let me tell you I really did the best I could

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been working from seven to eleven every night
I said it kinda makes my life a drag Lord, that ain't right, no no

[Chorus]
Since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose my worried mind
Watch out

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Said I've been crying, yeah Oh, my tears they fell like rain
Don't you hear, don't you hear them falling
Don't you hear, don't you hear them falling

[Verse 3]
Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door?
I said you had the nerve to tell me You didn't want me no more, yeah
I open my front door, hear my back door slam
You know, you must have one of them new fangled New fangled back door man

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been working from seven, seven, seven to eleven every night
It kinda makes my life a drag, a drag, drag Ah, yeah, it makes a drag

[Chorus]
Baby, since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose
I'm about to lose, lose my worried mind
Just one more, just one more

[Outro]
Oh yeah Since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose my worried mind

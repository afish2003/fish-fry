[Intro]

[Verse 1 - 1]
walk down the highway
All I do is sing a song
And a train that's passin' my way
Helps rhythm move along
Is no doubt about the words are clear
The voice is strong it's oh so strong

[Verse 1 - 2]
Just simple guy
Live from day to day
A ray of sunshine melts my frown
Blows my blues away
Nothin' more that I can say
But on a day like today
Pass the time away
And walk a quiet mile with you

[Chorus]
All I need from you is all your love
All you gotta give to me is all your love
All I need from you is all your love
All you gotta give to me is all your love

[Bridge]
Ooh yeah ooh yeah
Ooh yeah ooh yeah

[Verse 2 - 1]
I'm so glad I'm livin'
Tell the world I am
I got me a fine woman
Says that I'm her man
Aone thing that I know for sure
Gonna give her all the lovin' like
nobody nobody nobody nobody can

[Verse 2 - 2]
Standin' in the noonday sun
Tryin' to flag a ride
People go and people come
See my rider right by my side
It's a total disgrace They set the pace
It must be race
The best thing I can do is run

[Chorus]
All I need from you is all your love
All you gotta give to me is all your love
All I need from you is all your love
All you gotta give to me is all your love

[Bridge]
Ooh yeah ooh yeah
Ooh yeah ooh yeah

[Outro]
Aw yeah aw yeah aw yeah Oh just remember said you'd be my one All I really said was be my one Ooh yeah ooh yeah ooh yeah Ooh yeah ooh yeah ooh yeah Ah hah hah hah hah hah yeah yeah Ah hah hah hah hah hah hah yeah yeah

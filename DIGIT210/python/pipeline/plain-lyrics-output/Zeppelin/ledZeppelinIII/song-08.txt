[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you,
I can't play with you no more,
I don't know how I'm gonna do what mama told me,
My friend, the boy next door.

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
I can't believe what people say_____ing,__
You're gon________na let your hair hang down,
I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long,
You're in the darker side of town.

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
And when I'm out I see you walking,
Why don't your eyes see me,
Or could it be you've found another game to play,
What did mama say to me.

[Chorus]
That's the way, oh,
That's the way it ought to be, Yeah, yeah,
mama say
That's the way it ought to stay.
Yeah, yeah, oh oh

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
And yes__ter___day I saw you standing by the river,
And weren't those tears that filled your eyes,
And all the fish that lay in dirty wa___ter___ dying,
Had they got you hypnotized?

[Interlude]

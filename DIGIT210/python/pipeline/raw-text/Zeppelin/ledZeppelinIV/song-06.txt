E5
Oh baby it's cryin' time
Oh baby I got to fly
A5                   G5
  Got to try to find a way
E5                      A5
  Got to try to get away
G5                                E5
  'Cause you know I gotta get away  from you babe
 
 
[Verse 2]
E5
Oh baby the river's red, ah baby in my head

  There's a funny feelin' goin' on
E5  A5                             G5

Craze, baby, the rainbow's end, mmm, baby, it's just a den
          G5        E5
For those who hide, hide their love to depths of life
A5                        G5
  And ruin dreams that we all knew so, babe
 
 
[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
E5
  Ooh yeah, brave I endure
Ooh yeah, strong shields and lore
A5                          G5
  They can't hold the wrath of those who walk
E5                                A5
  An' the boots of those who march
              G5                         E5 E5
Baby, through the roads of time so long ago

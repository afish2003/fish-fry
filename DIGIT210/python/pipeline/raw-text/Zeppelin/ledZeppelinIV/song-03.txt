[Verse 1]
    Am            C Am          C
The Queen of Light  took her bow
    Am              C    Am C
And then she turned to go
    Am             C  Am              C
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom
    Am               C    Am C
And walked the night alone
D
Oh, dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
Am              C       Am       C
Dark Lord rides in force  tonight
    Am               C   Am C
And time will tell us all
D
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe
Rest not to lock your homes
Am          C   Am            C
Side by side we wait the might
       Am         C       Am C
Of the darkest of them all
D Am C Am C Am C
Am C
 
 
[Chorus]
A7           D                   A7                   D
  I hear the horses' thunder down  in the valley below
G7                    C
  I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon
G7                      C
Waiting for the eastern glow
 
 
[Verse 2]
    Am        C      Am      C
The apples of the valley hold
Am                C     Am C
  The seeds of happiness
    Am             C    Am         C
The ground is rich from tender care
  Am          C      Am C D
Repay, do not forget,     no
Dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
Am         C   Am             C
Apples turn to brown and black
    Am            C  Am C
The tyrant's face is red
D
Oh, war is the common cry
Pick up your swords and fly
Am           C     Am          C
Sky is filled with good and bad
Am        C       Am C
Mortals never know
D Am C Am C Am C
Am C
 
 
[Chorus]
A7              D                 A7                     D
  Oh, well, the night is long the beads of time pass slow
G7                     C
  Tired eyes on the sunrise
G7                      C
Waiting for the eastern glow
 
 
[Verse 3]
    Am         C   Am        C
The pain of war cannot exceed
    Am       C      Am C
The woe of aftermath
    Am              C    Am         C
The drums will shake the castle wall
    Am                C        Am    C D
The ring wraiths ride in black,  ride  on
Sing as you raise your bow
Shoot straighter than before
   Am         C    Am           C
No comfort has the fire at night
     Am              C  Am  C
That lights the face so cold
D
 Dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
Am         C    Am          C
Magic runes are writ in gold
   Am          C     Am
To bring the balance back
      C      D
Bring it back
Am C Am C Am C Am C
 
 
[Chorus]
A7            D
  At last the sun is shining
    A7                    D
The clouds of blue roll by
G7                     C
  With flames from the dragon of darkness
    G7                  C    Am
The sunlight blinds his eyes!

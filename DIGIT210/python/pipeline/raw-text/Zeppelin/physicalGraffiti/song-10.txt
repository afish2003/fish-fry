Rivers always reach the sea.

[Chorus]
Asus2 A7sus2            Bsus4/A        Am6 F/A          A        Asus2 A7sus2
            Blind stars of     fortune,    each have several rays
             Bsus4/A      Am6 F/A           A
On the wings of     maybe,    down in birds of prey.
Asus2 A7sus2                Bsus4/A         Am6    F/A         A       Asus2 A7sus2
            Kind of makes me       feel sometimes, didn't have to grow,
             Bsus4/A                Am6     F/A           A
But as the eagle    leaves the nest,   it's got so far to go.

      Dm/F                        A  Adim/Eb Bm Em Dmaj7
think of  you, and how it used to be.

      Did you ever really need  somebody, and really need 'em bad?

Do you ever remember me, baby, did it feel so good?
A5           B5  A5    G5
Cause it was just  the first time, and you knew you would.

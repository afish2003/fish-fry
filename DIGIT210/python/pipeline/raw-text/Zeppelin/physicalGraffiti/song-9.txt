  Down by the seaside
C                 F
 See the boats go sailing
C                   F
 Can the people hear
   C                         F
Oh, what the little fish are saying?

[Verse 2]
C            F
 Down in the city streets
C                    F
 See all the folk go racing, racing
C             F
 No time left, oh no
C                    F
 To pass the time of day

Hey, hey, yeah

The people turned away
    F              Am
The people turned away
 
 
[Interlude]
So far away, so far away
See how they run, see how they run
See how they run, see how they run...
Do you still do the twist?
                                    D
Do you find you remember things that well?
I wanna tell you
        Am
Some go twisting every day
                                    D
Though sometimes it's awful hard to tell

  Out in the country
C                F
 Hear the people singing
C                    F
 Singing about their growin'
C                      F
 Knowing where they're goin'

 Sing loud for the sunshine
C                  F
 Pray hard for the rain
C                       F
 And show your love for Lady Nature
C                        F
 And she will come back again

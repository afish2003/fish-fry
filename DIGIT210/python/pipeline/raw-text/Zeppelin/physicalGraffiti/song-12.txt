[Verse 1]
G5
  Silent woman in the night, you came
                                  F7 Gb7
Took my seed from my shaking frame
G5
  Same old fire, another flame
And the wheel rolls on
D5 Db5 C5 Bb5
 
 
[Verse 2]
G5
  Silent woman through the flames, you come
                            F7 Gb7
From the deep behind the sun
G5
  Seems my nightmares, my loving gun
Left me barely holding on
D5 Db5 C5 Bb5

[Verse 3]
G5
  With blazing eyes you see my trembling hand
                              F7 Gb7
When we know the time has come
G5
  Lose my senses, lose command
Feel your healing rivers run
D5 Db5 C5 Bb5
 
 
[Verse 4]
G5
  Is it every time I fall
                             F7 Gb7
That I think this is the one?
G5
  Ooh, in the darkness can you hear me call?
Another day has just begun
D5 Db5 C5         Bb5
      Another day,   yeah

[Verse 5]
G5
  Silent woman, my face is changed
                         F7 Gb7
Some know in ways to come
G5
  Feel my fire needs a brand new flame
                       D5 Db5 C5 Bb5     D5 Db5  C5 Bb5
And the wheel rolls on,             rolls      on
D5 Db5 C5 Bb5     D5 Db5   C5 Bb5 D5 Db5 C5 Bb5     D5 Db5   C5 Bb5     D5 Db5 C5 Bb5
             Rolls      on,                    rolls      on,      babe,             oooh

N.C.
 
[Verse]
 
D/A                          A
I received a message from my brother across the water
       D/A                               A
He sat laughin' as he wrote the end's in sight
D/A                         A
So I said goodbye to all my friends
                             D/A
And packed my hopes inside a matchbox
                   A
'Cause I know it's time to fly 
 
[Chorus]
 
E                                  G                            D
  Come on, meet me in the morning, Meet me in the middle of the night
F     C                        G
  The morning light is comin', don't it make you wanna go and feel alright
 
A D/A A D/A A D/A A D/A
 
[Verse]
 
D/A                              A
I just jumped a train that never stops,
                           D/A                          A
So now somehow I'll know I never finished payin' for my ride
        D/A                          A
Just n' someone pushed a gun into my hand
                        D/A                                A
Tell me I'm the type of man to fight the fight that I'll require 
 
[Chorus]
 
E                                  G                            D
  Come on, meet me in the morning, Meet me in the middle of the night
F     C                        G
  The morning light is comin', don't it make you wanna go and feel alright

N.C.
Oh, mama, well I think it's time I'm leavin'
G
Nothin' here to make me stay 
G
Whoa, mama, well it must be time I'm goin' 
N.C.
They're knockin' down them doors
                  G7
They're tryin' to take me away 
 
C                                                G
  Please Mr. Brakeman, won't you ring your bell. And ring loud and clear 
C
  Please Mr. Fireman, won't you ring your bell 
G
  Tell the people they got to fly away from here

[Verse]
 
D/A                       A
I once saw a picture of a lady with a baby 
         D/A                     A
Southern lady, have a very, very special smile 
D/A                         A
  We are in the middle of a change in destination
D/A                                          A
  When the train stops, all together we will smile
 
[Chorus]
 
E
  Oh, meet me in the morning. 
         G                             D
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, night 
F                    C
  Everybody know the mornin' time is comin' 
G
Don't it make you wanna feel alright. Ah, ah, yeah 
G
Make me feel alright. Fly now, baby 
G
Get to fly, yeah. Fly now, baby

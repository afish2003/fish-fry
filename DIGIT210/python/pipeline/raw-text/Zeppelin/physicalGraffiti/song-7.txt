In The Light
Physical Graffiti

[Intro]
A5
And if you feel that you can't go on
And your will's sinkin' low
Just believe and you can't go wrong
In the light you will find the road
                      A5
You will find the road
 
 
[Verse 1]
A5
Hey, oh, did you ever believe that I could leave you
Standing out in the cold
Hey, babe, I know how it feels 'cause I have slipped through
To the very depths of my soul yeah
Oh, baby, I just want to show you what I'd give you
It is from every bend in the road
Now listen to me
Oh, whoawhoa, as I was and really would be for you, too, honey
As you would for me, oh, I would share your load
Let me share your load, oh, let me share, share your load

And if you feel that you can't go on
In the light you will find the road
 
 
[Verse 2]
A5
Hey, oh, though the winds of change may blow around you
But that will always be so
Wowwow, wowwow, when love is pain it can devour you
If you are never alone
I would share your load, I would share your load
Baby, let me, oh, let me

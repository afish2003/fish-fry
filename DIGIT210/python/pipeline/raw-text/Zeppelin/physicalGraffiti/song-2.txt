[Verse 1]
E
 I've been to London
Seen seven wonders
I know to trip is just to fall
I used to rock it
Sometimes I'd roll it
I always knew what it was for
 
 
[Chorus]
F#m E D                   G   F#m A E
       There can be no denyin'
                               G
That the wind'll shake 'em down
F#m E D                     G     F#m A E
       And the flat world's flying
                            G
And a new plague on the land
F#m E         D
    Just join hands
         C#m       B
We could just join hands
            A
If we could just join
 
 
[Verse 2]
E
 Traversed the planet
When heaven sent me
I saw the kings who rule them all
Still by the firelight
And purple moonlight
I hear the rested rivers call
 
 
[Chorus]
F#m E D                G  F#m A E
       And the wind is cryin 
                                G
From a love that won't grow cold
F#m E D                G F#m A E
       My lover she is lying
                             G
On the dark side of the globe
F#m E         D
    Just join hands
         C#m       B
We could just join hands
 
 
[Bridge]
   A                 E     Dmaj7/E E E Dmaj7/E E
If we could just join hands
E Dmaj7/E E E Dmaj7/E E
E    Dmaj7/E                        E
 You got    me rockin' when I ought to be arollin' darlin'
E        Dmaj7/E                 E
Tell me, darlin', which way to go
E    Dmaj7/E                      E
 You keep   me rockin' baby, then you keep me stolen
          E       Dmaj7/E                 E
Won't you tell me darlin', which way to go
That's right

[Verse 3]
E
 Oh how I wonder
Oh how I worry
And I would dearly like to know
I've all this wonder
Of earthly plunder
Will it leave us anything to show
 
 
[Chorus]
F#m E D                G  F#m A E
       And our time is flyin'
                          G
See the candle burning low
F#m E D                 G  F#m A E                            G
       Is the new world rising   From the shambles of the old?
F#m         E         D
   We could just join hands
            C#m       B          A
If we could just join hands If we
                        E
could just, if we could just, if we could just
 
 
[Outro]
If we could just, if we could just join hands
That's all it takes, that's all it takes
That's all it takes, that's all it takes

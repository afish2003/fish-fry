D        D5           A#               Bm                     Csus2
 Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face  with stars to fill my     dream.
D      D5          A#                    Bm                   Csus2
 I am a  traveller of both time and space  to be where I have been,
D           D5      A#                Bm                      Csus2
 To sit with  elders  of a gentle race  this world has seldom seen.
D            D5         A#                      Bm                   Csus2  D D5 A#
 They talk of  days for which they sit and wait,  when all will be revealed.

 Talk and  song from tongues of lilting grace,  whose sounds caress my ear. 
D         D5       A#                   Bm                    Csus2
 But not a  word I heard could I relate,  the story was quite clear.
D   D5 A# Bm
 Oh.
Csus2 D   D5 A# Bm Csus2
       Oh.

Ooh, baby, I've been flying.
Ooh, yeah. Oh mama baby, there ain't no denying.

  All I see turns to brown  as the sun burns the ground.
G5                      A5  G5                  A5
  And my eyes fill with sand  as I scan this wasted land.
G5                                             A5 D5 A# Bm Csus2
  Try'n to find, try'n to find where I've been.
D D5 A# Bm Csus2

 Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace  like thoughts inside a dream.
D           D5          A#                  Bm                 Csus2
 Who hid the  path that led me to that place  of yellow desert screen.
D       D5           A#                 Bm                  Csus2
 My shangrila beneath  the summer moon, I will return again.
D        D5            A#                       Bm                     Csus2
 Sure as the dust that floats high in June when moving through Kashmir.

 Oh father of the four winds, fill my sails,  'cross the sea of years,
D        D5       A#                Bm                          Csus2
 With no provision  but an open face  along the straits of fear.
   D5 A#   Bm
Oh,     oh.
Csus2 D   D5 A# Bm Csus2
       Oh.

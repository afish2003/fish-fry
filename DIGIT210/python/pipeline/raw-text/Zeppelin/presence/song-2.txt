[Verse 1]
C5
  You said I was the only
                          G5
With my lemon in your hand  oh oh oh oh
C5
  Exhibition is your habit
                   G5
Emotion second hand  oh oh oh oh
C5
  Had to pull away to save me
                      G5
Maybe next time around  oh
             Eb5                  F5
And she said,   don't you want it?
          Bb5           C5  G5
Don't you wanna cocaine,  cocaine, cocaine?
Eb5                         F5       Bb5

[Verse 2]
C5
  Heard a cry for mercy
In the city of the damned
G5
  Oh, oh, babe, deep damned
C5
  In the pits you go no lower
The next stop's underground oh
G5
  Hello underground
C5
  Your wine and roses ain't quite over
                                G5
'Till favour deals a losing hand
           Eb5
And I said,   didn't mean to
F5         Bb5           C5  G5
Did not converne to fluff  it
Eb5                    F5  Bb5    C5 A5
   You didn't plan it, you overran   it
 
 
[Bridge]
G5
  You wanna do it, you wanna
You wanna do it when you wanna
Do you wanna, do when you wanna
                             G5
Do you when do when you wanna
 
 
[Chorus]
G5
  When you blow it, babe
You got to blow it right
Oh baby, if you fake it, mama
Baby, fake with all of your might
A5
  When you fake it, mama
Please fake it right it's for yourself, babe
When you fake it, baby
You're faking it for your life, for your life
                                       G5
For your life, for your life, for your life
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it when you wanna
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
                    G5
Do it when you wanna
 
 
[Pre-Verse]
G5
  Oh, I can have you, baby
But I don't know what to do, yeah
Sometime, baby, nothing I could do yeah
 
 
[Verse 3]
C5
  On the balance of a crystal
Paying through the nose
G5 C5
     And when they couldn't resist you
                            G5
I thought you'd go with the flow
C5
  And now your stage is empty
Bring down the curtain, baby please
G5
  Fold up your show
Eb5                  F5       Bb5
   Hadn't planned to Could not
        C5   G5
stand to  fry  in it
Eb5              F5
Hadn't planned it
   Bb5       C5 G5   Eb5 F5
I overran it,     frying
Bb5     C5 G5   Eb5 F5 Bb5     C5 G5
For your   life,       for your   life

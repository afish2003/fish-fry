[Verse 1]
E        D5      E                D5
One time love,   take care how you use it
E               D5            E            D5
Try to make it last all night
           E          D5      E                D5
And if you take your pick, be careful how you choose it
E             D5                   E           D5
Sometimes its hard to feel it bite

E       D5          E            D5
A man I know, went down to Louisiana
E             D5     E            D5
Had himself a bad, bad fight
    E                   D5
And when the sun peeked through
      E             D5
John Cameron with Suzanna
E             D5        E            D5
He kissed the whiskers, left and right

[Verse 3]
               E            D5
Now, now, now, fright subsides
         E            D5
Out at a hotel in the quarter
E             D5                      E            D5
Our friends check in to pass the night
E             D5        E            D5
Now love gets hot, but fire preceded water
E             D5                 E            D5
Poor whiskers set that room alight

E7
Down on Bourbon street, You know it's right
E7
You can see my friend
E7
They run around all through the night
E7
Most everywhere ,Until the closet's bare
E7
Run for the razor ,Doin' up my hair
 
[Verse 5]
E             D5
New Orleans queens
E                 D5
Sure know how to schmooze it
E                   D5       E            D5
Maybe for some that seems alright
E             D5      E                D5
When I step out     Strut down with my sugar
E             D5      E            D5
She'd best not talk like Barry White
 
[Verse 6]
E             D5      E            D5
One time love,   take care how you use it
E             D5      E            D5
Try to make it last all night
E             D5      E            D5
And if you take your pick, be careful how you choose it
E             D5      E            D5
Sometimes its hard to feel it bite

      D                         E
I was burned in the heat of the moment,
          D                                  E
Though it couldn't have been the heat of the day
       D                            E
When I learned how my time had been wasted,
        D                     E
(And a) tear fell as I turned away
 
         D                                  E
Now I've got friends who will give me their shoulder,
 D                       E
Event I should happen to fall
D                          E
Time and his bride growing older
         D                             E
I've got friends who will give me fuck all
 
[Chorus]
 
   D                    E
La la la la la la la la la, yeah
   D                    E
La la la la la la la la la, my baby
   D                    E
La la la la la la la la la, yeah
   D                    E
La la la la la la la la la

         D                     E
(On the) corner of Bleeker and nowhere
       D                 E
In the land of not quite day
  D                   E
A shiver runs down my backbone
D                        E
Face in the mirror turns grey
 
       D                            E
So (I) looked round to hitch up the reindeer
          D                           E
Searching hard trying to brighten the day
  D                             E
I turned around to look for the snowman
   D                       E
To my surprise he'd melted away.
 
[Chorus]
 
   D                    E
La la la la la la la la la, yeah
   D                    E
La la la la la la la la la, my baby
   D                    E
La la la la la la la la la, yeah
   D                    E
La la la la la la la la la

[Verse]
 
       D                           E
As the moon and the stars call the order
          D                       E
Inside my tides dance the ebb and sway
    D                        E
The sun in my soul's sinking lower
          D                         E
While the hope in my hands turns to clay
 
        D                           E
I don't ask that my field's full of clover
        D                     E
I don't moan at opportunity's door
           D                      E
And if you ask my advice, take it slower
          D                        E
Then your story'd be your finest reward.
 
[Chorus]
 
   D                    E
La la la la la la la la la, yeah
   D                    E
La la la la la la la la la, my baby
   D                    E
La la la la la la la la la, yeah
   D                    E
La la la la la la la la la

[Verse]
 
D                   E
Lost on the path to attainment
D                         E
Search in the eyes of the wise
       D                          E
When I bled from the heart of the matter
          D                     E
I started bleeding without a disguise
 
    D                       E
Now everything's fine under heaven
        D                               E
Now and then you've got to take time to pause
            D                            E
When you're down on the ground, don't be messin' around
          D                      E
Or you'll land in a boat without oars
 
[Chorus]
 
   D                    E
La la la la la la la la la, yeah
   D                    E
La la la la la la la la la, my baby
   D                    E
La la la la la la la la la, yeah
   D                    E

Hey babe, Hey babe, Hey babe,

I lost my way.
E         D
  Hey babe, Hey babe,
A
  I really, really did.
 
E         D
  Hey babe, Hey babe,
A
  I don't know where I'm gonna find it.
 
E         D
  Hey babe, Hey babe,
       A
Do you wanna know,
A
Do you really, really, wanna help me, yeah?

Let me tell you now, babe

That it feels so good that it must be right

Now my babe,

Let me tell you

That it feels so good that it must be right...

That it feels, that it feels, that it feels, that it feels

So good, so good, so good, oh yeah, so good.

[Intro]
E7                      A13
  And if I say to you tomorrow
 
 
[Verse 1]
E7                    A13
  Take my hand, child come with me
E7                        A13
  It's to a castle I will take you
E7                            A13
  Where what's to be, they say   will be
 
 
[Chorus]

Catch the wind, see us spin

Sail away leave today

Way up high in the sky, hey, whoa
But the wind won't blow
    A7
You really shouldn't go

  Oh what fun it all   would be
E7                           A13
  Then what's to stop us, pretty baby
E7                A13
  But what is and what should never be

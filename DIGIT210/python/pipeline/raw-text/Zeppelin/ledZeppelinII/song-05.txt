[Verse 1]
A
Hey fellas have you heard the news
D             A
You know that Annie's back in town
                                     D
It won't take long just watch and see
        A
And the fellas lay their money down
                                      D
Her style is new but the face the same
      A
As it was so long ago
    A                              D
But from her eyes a different smile
     A                    D
Like that of one who knows

[Verse 2]
          A                           D
Well it's been ten years or maybe more
        A
Since I first set eyes on you
                                 D
The best years of my life gone by
       A
Here I am alone and blue
                                   D
Some people cry and some people die
       A
By the wicked ways of love
                                   D
But I'll just keep on rolling along
         A                      D
With the grace of the Lord above
A D A D A
 
 
[Verse 3]
C
People talking all around
About the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at
D
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify please do
         E
It's the way you call me by another guy's name
When I try to make love to you
I try to make love but it isn't no use
Give it to me
Give it

        Work so hard I couldn't unwind
                    D
Get some money saved
 A
Abuse my love a thousand times
                    D
However hard I tried
A
Heartbreaker your time has come
                         D
Can't take your evil ways
A                 D A D A D A D A D A D
Go away Heartbreaker

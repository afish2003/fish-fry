[Verse 1]
Em              Cmaj7
  My tea's gone cold 
                 D      G      D/F#      Em                Cmaj7
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all  The morning rain
                D
clouds up my window
    G       D/F#      Em           Cmaj7
And I can't see at all  And even if
                 D                 G         D/F#
I could, it'd all be grey But your picture on
my wall
Em          Cmaj7             Em
  It reminds     me that it's not so bad
     Cmaj7
It's not  so bad
Em Cmaj7 Em Cmaj7
 
 
[Verse 2]
Em                Cmaj7
  I drank too much     last night
         D
Got bills to pay
   G         D/F#     Em                   Cmaj7
My head just feels in pain I missed the bus
                    D
and there'll be hell today
    G        D/F#      Em           Cmaj7
I'm late for work again  And even if
I'm there
            D            G         D/F#
They'll all imply that I might not last the day
Em                 Cmaj7
  And then you call     me
         Em
And it's not so bad
     Cmaj7
It's not  so bad
 
 
[Chorus]
G             Cmaj7
And I want to thank you
                  G              Cmaj7
For giving me the best day of my life 
G           Cmaj7
Oh, just to be   with you
              Bm7            Am7
Is having the best day of my life

[Verse 3]
G                              Cmaj7
 Push the door I'm home at last
                                   G
And I'm soaking through and through
                          Cmaj7                    G
Then you handed me a towel     and all I see is you
                               Cmaj7
And even if my house falls down     now
                      Bm7
I wouldn't have a clue
               Am7
Because you're near me
 
 
[Chorus]
G             Cmaj7
And I want to thank you
                  G              Cmaj7
For giving me the best day of my life 
G           Cmaj7
Oh, just to be   with you
              Bm7            Am7
Is having the best day of my life
G             Cmaj7
And I want to thank you
                  G              Cmaj7
For giving me the best day of my life 
G           Cmaj7
Oh, just to be   with you
              Bm7            Am7
Is having the best day of my life

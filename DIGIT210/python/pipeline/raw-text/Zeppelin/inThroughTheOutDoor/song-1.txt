[Intro]
E
In the evening
 
 
[Verse 1]
E D A
     When the day is done
E D A                  E    D A                E          D A            E   D A               E   D A
     I'm looking for a woman   Oh, but the girl don't come   So don't let her   Play you for a fool
                 E         D A                              E    D A
She don't show no pity baby   I know that she don't make no rules
 
 
[Chorus]
D                   A D                A D                    A D
Oh, I need your love   I need your love   Oh, I need your love   I just got to have
A D             E      D A
   So don't you let her
 
 
[Verse 2]
                  E    D A                           E  D A
Oh, get under your skin   It's only bad luck and trouble
                     E     D A                             E   D A
From the day that you begin   I hear you crying in the darkness
                   E   D A
Don't ask nobody's help
                     E               D A
Oh, ain't no pockets full of mercy baby
 
 
[Chorus]
                          E        D A G                    D G                        E A                         E A
Because you can only blame yourself     Oh, I need your love   Oh, oh, I need your love   Oh yeah, I need your love   I got to 
have
 
 
[Verse 3]
B        E     D A
 Oh it's simple
                         E      D A                          E        D        A
All the pain that you go through   You can turn away from fortune, fortune, fortune
                                    E D A
'Cause that's all that's left to you
It's lonely at the bottom
E D A                          E D A
     Man, it's dizzy at the top
                   E                D A
But if you're standing in the middle
                          E    D A
Ain't no way you're gonna stop,   oh, babe
 
 
[Chorus]
D                        A D                        A D                        A D             A D
 Oh, oh, I need your love   Oh, oh, I need your love   Oh, oh, I need your love   I got to have

[Verse 4]
   E    D A                   E    D A
Whatever   That your days may bring
                   E      D  A
No use hiding in a corner, oh no
                         E       D A                         E       D A              E          D          A
Because that won't change a thing   If you're dancing in the doldrums   One day soon, it's got to stop, it's got to stop
                   E             D     A
When you're the master of the offchance
                 E     D   A
When you don't expect a lot
 
 
[Chorus]
G                    D G                        E A                         E A              B
 Oh, I need your love   Oh, oh, I need your love   Oh yeah, I need your love   I got to have, I got to have
 
 
[Outro]
E D A                        E   D A
     Babe I got to have your love
             E D A
I got to have
                        E    D A
Babe, I got to have your love
E D A   E D    A
     Oh,   have your love
 
 
[Fade Out]
E  D A                 E         D A
Oh,   oh, I got to have your love   Just got to
E D       A
   I just got
          E  D  A
I just gotta, oh
E  D A       E D A E  D A
Oh,   oh, oh,      oh,   oh

In Through the Out Door

[VERSE 1]
C
Baby, when you walk that sweet walk
                Am
Oh, you walk it good, yes you walk it good
 C
Baby, when you talk that sweet talk
                 Am
Oh, it sounds so good, oh so good
 
[CHORUS]
F                          C
With a little bit of concentration
F                          C
And a little bit of helpin' hands, yeah
F                          C
And a little bit of raving madness
Bb                               F
You know it makes me feel, baby
 F                           C
Both my feet are back on the ground
 
[VERSE 2]
C
And when the rhythm takes me
            Am
It feels so good, oh so good
C
Baby if it keeps a-shaking
               Am
It will do you good, oh so much good
 
[CHORUS 2]
F                            C
With a little bit of stop-a-shakin' shakin'
F                              C
And a little bit of ?fly right down?
F                           C
Ooh a little bit of Sweet Co-Connie
Bb                              F
It makes me feel, makes me feel
                     C
I got my feet on the ground
 
[SOLO]
Am     C     Am      F     C     F     C     F    C    Bb    F
 
[VERSE 3]
        C
Ooh now baby, when you move it makes me
               Am
Really feel so good, oh so good
C
And I'm so glad, so glad, so glad, so glad
        Am
And I'm good, oh, so good
 
[CHORUS]
F                          C
With a little bit of concentration
F                           C
Took a little bit of helping hand
F                           C
Ooh a little bit of ?saving madness?
Bb                              F
You know it makes me feel, baby
                 C
I'm back on the ground oh yes, sure does
Bb               F             C
It makes me feel back on the ground.
Bb        F                       C
Baby baby you make it Down on the ground.

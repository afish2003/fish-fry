[Verse 1]
Am              G            Dm
  Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light
Am           G              D
  To chase a feather in the wind
Am               G              Dm
  Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
Am                    G            D
  There moves a thread that has no end
Am              G         Dm
  For many hours and days that pass ever soon
Am               G                D
  The tides have caused the flame to dim
Am               G                 Dm
  At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Am              G       D
  Is this to end or just begin?
 
 
[Chorus]
C               Em/B
All of my love, all of my love
Am            G   F
All of my love to you, now
C               Em/B
All of my love, all of my love
    Am            G   F
Oh, all of my love to you, now
 
 
[Verse 2]
Am                  G             Dm
  The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
Am             G                  D
  One voice is clear above the din
Am             G             Dm
  Proud Arianne one word, my will to sustain
Am                 G             D
  For me, the cloth once more to spin
 
 
[Chorus]
C               Em/B
All of my love, all of my love
Am            G    F
All of my love for you now
C               Em/B
All of my love, all of my love, yes
Am            G   F
All of my love to you, child

[Verse 3]
Am                   G            Dm
  Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time
Am                G                D
  His is the force that lies within
Am                 G    Dm
  Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find
Am        G              D
  He is a feather in the wind
 
 
[Chorus]
C               Em/B
All of my love, all of my love
Am            G   F
All of my love to you, now
C               Em/B
All of my love, oh  yes
Am            G   F
All of my love to you

[Intro]
C C/D C/E F G C C/D C/E F G
                           Oh, baby
C C/D C/E F G C C/D C/E F G               C     C/D C/E  F                 G
                           Well there's a light in  your eye that keeps shining
 
 
[Verse 1]
       C    C/D  C/E   F             G
Like a star that can't wait for night
C C/D C/E  F                   G
  I   hate to think I been blinded baby
C C/D C/E   F                 G
  Why can't I see you tonight?
        C      C/D C/E  F                G
And the warmth of  your smile starts a burning
        C      C/D C/E  F            G
And the thrill of  your touch give me fright
        C  C/D  C/E F               G
And I'm shaking so  much, really yearning
              C    C/D C/E F                   G C C/D C/E F G
Why don't you show up      and make it alright,               yeah?
 
 
[Bridge]
C C/D C/E F            G
  It's    alright right
C C/D C/E F G C C/D C/E F G           C  C/D   C/E   F             G
                           And if you promised you'd love so completely
 
 
[Verse 2]
        C    C/D C/E   F        G
And you said you would always be true
    C     C/D  C/E F                G
You swore that you never would leave me baby
C C/D C/E F                 G
  Whate_ver happened to you?
        C       C/D C/E   F       G              C    C/D C/E  F                      G
And you thought it     was only in movies As you wish all your dreams would come true, hey
C C/D C/E   F                     G
  It  ain't the first time believe me baby
C C/D C/E F                      G C   C/D C/E F G
  I'm standing here feeling blue,  blue           ha!
 
 
[Bridge]
            C C/D C/E F G
Yes I'm blue
C C/D C/E F G        C C/D C/E F G           C     C/D C/E F              G
             Oh, babe             Now I will stand in  the rain on the corner
 
 
[Verse 3]
            C  C/D C/E F             G
I watch the people go  shuffling downtown
 C C/D  C/E F             G
Another ten minutes no longer
C C/D C/E  F                  G
  And then I'm turning around, 'round
        C     C/D C/E   F             G           C  C/D   C/E F                  G
And the clock on     the wall's moving slower Oh, my heart it  sinks to the ground
        C     C/D  C/E F                   G
And the storm that I   thought would blow over
           C     C/D C/E F          G       C    C/D C/E F G
Clouds the light of  the love that I found, found
 
 
[Bridge]
                              C C/D C/E F G
Light of the love that I found
                              C C/D C/E F G
Light of the love that I found
                C C/D C/E F G
Oh, that I found

And I'll run in  the rain till I'm breathless
         C     C/D C/E F                    G
When I'm breathless    I'll run till I drop, hey!
        C        C/D C/E F                 G
And the thoughts of  a   fool's gotta count

[Verse 1]
G
Well I just got into town today
C
To find my girl who's gone away
G                                    D
She took the Greyhound at the General Store
G
I searched myself I searched the town
C
When I finally did sit down
G       D          G
I find myself no wiser than before
G
She said we couldn't do no wrong
C
No other love could be so strong
G                                    D
She locked up my heart in her bottom drawer
G
Now she took my heart she took my keys
C
From in my old blue dungarees
G          D         G
And I'll never go to Texas anymore
 
[Chorus]
D                      G
  Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do
    D                                     G
She took my love and walked right out the door
    C                          G
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure
    A                                 D
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before
 
[Verse 2]
G
I took her love at seventeen
C
A little late these days it seems
G                                          D
But they said heaven is well worth waiting for
G
I took her word I took it all
C
Beneath the sign that said "U-haul"
G            D               G
She left angels hangin round for more
 
(Guitar break)
 
[Chorus]
D                      G
  Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do
    D                                     G
She took my love and walked right out the door
    C                          G
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure
    A                                 D
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before
 
[Verse 3]
G
I thought I had it all sewn up
C
Our love, a plot, a pick-up truck
G                                      D
But folks said she was after something more
G
I never did quite understand
C
All that talk about rockin' bands
    G                   D                  G
But they just rolled my doll right out the door
         G                   D                  G
Oh yeah, they just rolled my doll right out the door
      G                   D                  G
Well, they just rolled my doll right out the door!

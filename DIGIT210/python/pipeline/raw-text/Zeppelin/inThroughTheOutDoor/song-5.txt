[Verse 1]
F/C          C                      F/C                 C
   Sisters of the wayside bide their time in quiet peace
F/C                    C                    F/C   C
   A-wait their place within the ring of calm
Dm/A       A              Dm/A                 A
   Still stand to turn in seconds of release
Dm/A                   A              Dm/A  A  Dm/A
  A-wait the call they know may never come
F/C                  C            F/C            C
   In times of lightness, no intruder dared upon
F/C                  C                   F/C    C
   To jeopardize the course, upset the run
Dm/A          A                   Dm/A               A
   And all was joy, and hands were raised toward the sun
Dm/A                     A          Dm/A    A
   As love in the halls of plenty overrun
 
[Chorus]
Dsus  D  Dsus D   Dsus  D  Dsus  D
  Ahhhh,   ahhhh,   ahhhh,  ahhhhh

[Verse 2]
F/C      C                      F/C             C
   Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast
F/C                       C            F/C  C
   Unending dances shadowed on the day
Dm/A            A           Dm/A                 A
   Within the wall, their daunting formless keep
Dm/A                   A                       Dm/A   A  Dm/A
   Preserved their joy that kept their doubts at bay
F/C                 C            F/C             C
   Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep
F/C                  C                  F/C    C
   Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray
Dm/A           A                     Dm/A               A
   And everything is soon, no sooner thought than deed
Dm/A                     A              Dm/A    A
   But no one seemed to question in any way
 
[Chorus]
Dsus  D  Dsus D   Dsus  D  Dsus  D
  Ahhhh,   ahhhh,   ahhhh,  ahhhhh

[Verse 3]
F/C         C                        F/C                    C
   How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land
F/C                   C                 F/C  C
   To seek the unsuspecting and the weak
Dm/A              A                Dm/A                 A
   And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand
Dm/A                      A                Dm/A  A   Dm/A
   Toward the foe that threatened from the deep
F/C                      C            F/C             C
   Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand
F/C                  C             F/C    C
  Adrift upon a sea of futile speech?
Dm/A        A                   Dm/A               A
   And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan'
Dm/A                         A                     Dm/A    A
   But no one there had heaven within their reach

[Interlude 1]
Cmaj7                          A        Cmaj7    A
   Where was your word, where did you go?
Cmaj7                                   A     Cmaj7   A
  Where was your helping, where was your bow,         bow?

Cmaj7                                 A     Cmaj7      A
   Hard was the journey, dark was the way,             way

[Interlude 3]
Cmaj7                          A        Cmaj7    A
    I heard the word, I couldn't stay, oh
Cmaj7                                 A         Cmaj7     A      Cmaj7  A
   I couldn't stand it another day, another day,      another Day

[Bridge]
G
Touched by the timely coming
G
Roused from the keeper's sleep
A
Release the grip
A
Throw down the key
D
Held now within the knowing
D
Rest now within the peace
A
Take of the fruit
A
But guard the seed
D    A  B7  A  B7   A  B7
 
(Funky Beat 2)
G    A

Held now within the knowing

Rest now within the beat

Take of the fruit

But guard the seed
 
D    A  B7                   A  B7                    A    B7 C

[Intro]
G5    E5  G5    E5
 
[Verse 1]
G5                         A5                 E5 G5
Oh, know I feel so strange looking out the door
                              A5            E5 G5
Oh, trying hard to change and can't let it go
                                  A5          E5 G5
Oh, crying tears of pain, hurting more and more
                                A5          E5 A5
Oh, every day's the same as you walk the floor
 
[Bridge]
A5
I'm walking the floor over you
A5             G5
I'm walking the floor
 
[Verse 2]
                                          E5
Every heart that breaks is a heart that's cold
                                A5        G5
Oh, to the hand that takes your dreamless soul
                  A5
Oh, is it long to wait, is there much to pay?
G5                              A5      E5
Oh, sometimes it's hard waiting for the day
 
[Chorus]
E5
You know it's hard, I said it's hard
E5
You know it's true
E5
I said it's hard, you know it's hard
                   G5
Still know it's true
 
[Verse 3]
                           A5           E5  G5
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
                               A5        E5  G5
When you hear the call can you count the cost?
                          A5     E5  G5
As you stand alone do you wonder how?
                    A5         E5     A5
Can you step aside, does it matter now?
 
[Interlude]
A5      G5
 
[Verse 4]
G5                                 A5  E5 G5
Every love that's changed spend it fully
                        A5      E5          G5
In the eyes of the night was it hard to see?
                           E5       G5
If it never fails in spite of it all
                          A5    E5
So you hide in the tears, enter Walter's walk
 
[Chorus]
E5
You know it is true now
E5
You know it is true now
E5
Ooh, yeah
 
[Guitar Solo]
E5     G5    E5  G5   A5 E5 G5
A5 E5 G5    A5
 
[Bridge]
     G5                     E5 A5
I am walking the floor over you
E5               G5
I am walking the floor
 
[Verse 5]
                      A5      E5            G5
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
                        A5                E5   G5
When you hear the call, can you count the cost?
                          A5       E5 G5
As you stand alone do you wonder how?
                            E5          G5
Can you step aside, does it matter now?
 
[Outro]
        E5         G5
Does it matter now?
            E5
Does it, now does it matter?
E5
Does it matter?
E5
Ooh yeah
E5
Ooh yeah
E5
Ooh, little baby, don't you know
E5
Every tear that falls, does it matter now?
E5
Does it matter now?
E5
Oh yeah
E5
Oh yes
E5
Oh yes
E5

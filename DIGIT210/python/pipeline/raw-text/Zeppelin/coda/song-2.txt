[Intro]
N.C.
 
[Verse 1]
N.C.
Here's a tale of Tom
N.C.
Who worked the railroads long
N.C.
His wife would cook his meal
N.C.
As he would change the wheel
N.C.
Poor Tom, seventh son
N.C.
Always knew what was going on
Am                 E+/G#                C/G  C
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
               Am             E+/G#                 C/G  C   F7/A
And there ain't  nothing that you can hide from Tom
 
[Verse 1]
C
Worked for thirty years
C
Sharing hopes and fears
C
Dreaming of the day
C
He could turn and say
C
Poor Tom, work is done
C
Been lazing out in the noonday sun
Am                 E+/G#               C/G  C
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
     Am             E+/G#             C/G   F7/A  C
Ain't  nothing that you can hide from Tom
 
[Verse 2]
C
His wife was Annie Mae
C
With any man a game she would play
C
When Tom was out of town
C
She couldn't keep her dresses down
C
Poor Tom, seventh son
C
Always knew what was going on
Am                 E+/G#               C/G   C
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
     Am             E+/G#             C/G   F7/A  C
Ain't  nothing that you can hide from Tom
 
[Verse 3]
C
And so it was one day
C
People got to Annie Mae
C
Tom stood, a gun in his hand
C
And stopped her running around
C
Poor Tom, seventh son
C
Gotta die for what you have done
Am                 E+/G#              C/G  C
All those years of work are thrown away
  Am              E+/G#               C/G
To ease your mind is that all you can say?

F7/A                                     C
But what about that grandson on your knee?
     C11                                 C  C11  C  C11  C
Them railroad songs, Tom would sing to me
           C11                                 C
There ain't   nothing that you can hide from Tom
      Am                 E+/G#               C/G  C
There ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
           Am                E+/G#                C/G  C
There ain't  nothing that you     can hide from Tom
C
Hey yeah, keep-a truckin'
C
Keep-a truckin'

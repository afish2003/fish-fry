       E                       D                 A/C#
In the days of my youth, I was told What it means
            E
to be a man.
D A/C#    E                                         D
      And now I've reached that age I've tried to do
          A/C#             E
All those things the best I can
D A/C#   E                          D            A/C#     E   D A/C#
      No matter how I try I find my way into the same old jam.

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share.

Well, my woman left home for a brown eyed man,
      B
But I still don't seem to care.
 
 
[Verse 2]
F#m
Sixteen I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be.
It only took a couple of days 'till she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me 'till the end,
But when I whispered in her ear I lost another friend. Oh!

Well, my woman left home for a brown eyed man,
      C#
But I still don't seem to care.

D    G                       D
 Hey lady, you got the love I need
G                 D
 Maybe more than enough
   G                                       D
Oh darling, darling, darling; walk a while with me
Cadd9   G          D        Dsus2 G D  Dsus2     G D       A
     Oh, you've got so much,         so     much,   so much

[Verse 1]
G                 A    G                  D  A
Many have I loved, and many times been bitten
G                    A G             A
Many times I've gazed along the open road
G A G A G A G D A
 
 
[Verse 2]
G                    A    G                  D    A
Many times I've lied, and many times I've listened
G                  A         G                A   G A
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know
G A G A G D A
 
 
[Verse 3]
G                     A    G                  D    A
Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
 G                 A      G                A
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold

G                A    G                       D   A
Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing
G            A      G                A
Many many men can't see the open road
G A G A G A G D A
 
 
[Verse 5]
G             A       G                 D   A
Many is a word that only leaves you guessing
G                     A    G                    A    D
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, ooh!
 
 
[Outro 1]
       G
Oh, oh, oh,
                D            G
Really ought to know, oh, oh,
                  D
I really ought to know
 
 
[Outro 1 (Fade Out)]
G D    G
 I you know, I should you know,
                   D                  G
I should you know, I should have known

[Verse 1]
                    F/A#
It is the springtime    of my loving,
                               F#/C
The second season I am to know.
                       F/A#
You are the sunlight in    my growing,
                                  F#/C
So little warmth I've felt before.
                        F/A#
It isn't hard to feel me    glowing.
I watched the fire that grew so low.

[Verse 2]
                    F/A#
It is the summer of my  smiles,
                                  F#/C
Flee from me Keepers of the Gloom.
                 F/A#
Speak to me only with your eyes.
                              F#/C
It is to you I give this tune.
                 F/A#
Ain't so hard to recognize, oh.
                                       F#/C        F/A#
These things are clear to all from time    to time.

Ooh.
 
 
[Bridge]
G5 D Bm F     F5         G5 C5   G5
Ah,      talk talk, talk,   talk.
G5                  D    Bm F         F5 G5
  I've felt the coldness of my winter,
C5               G5
  I never thought  it would ever go.
G5                   D    Bm    F        F5         G5
  I cursed the gloom that set upon us, upon us, upon  us,
C5          G5
  But I know  that I love you so.
G5     D Bm F
  Ah...
F5 G5 C5          G5                   F#/C
        But I know  that I love you so oh. 
 
 
[Verse 3]
                          F/A#                                         F#/C
These are the seasons of emotion and like the winds they rise and fall.
                      F/A#
This is the wonder of devotion.
                                  F#/C
I seek the torch we all must hold.
                           F/A#
This is the mystery of the quotient quotient.
                                                    F#/C
Oh, upon us all, upon us all a little rainmust fall.
                          F/A# Csus2 Gsus2
It's just a little rain...

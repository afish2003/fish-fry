[Intro]
G/D
 
 
[Verse 1]
C5                 Gdim/Ab
  Dancing days are here   again
   F/C                 C5  F/C
As the summer evenings grow
                   Gdim/Ab        F/G
I got my flower, I got    my power
                  C5
I got a woman who knows
 
 
[Chorus]
F/C                    Edim/F                     Dm/A
   I said it's alright,      You know it's alright
                       A    F/C
I guess it's all in my heart
                  Edim/F               Dm/A
You'll be my only,      my one and only
                          A
Is that the way it should start?
 
 
[Verse 2]
C5               Gdim/Ab
  Crazy ways are evident
   F/C                              C5     F/C
In the way that you're wearing your clothes
                 Gdim/Ab
Sippin' booze is precedent
   F/G                   C5
As the evening starts to glow
 
 
[Chorus]
F/C                      Edim/F                   Dm/A
   You know it's alright,      I said it's alright
                        A    F/C
You know it's all in my heart
                  Edim/F               Dm/A
You'll be my only,      my one and only
                                G/D
Is that the way it should start?
 
 
[Verse 3]
C5                        Gdim/Ab
  You told your mamma I'd get    you home
    F/C                     C5 F/C
But you didn't say I had no car
                    Gdim/Ab       F/G
I saw a lion he was standing alone
                    C5
With a tadpole in a jar
 
 
[Chorus]
F/C                      Edim/F                   Dm/A
   You know it's alright,      I said it's alright
                       A              F/C
I guess it's all in my heart, my heart
                  Edim/F               Dm/A
You'll be my only,      my one and only
                          A
Is that the way it should start?
 
 
[Verse 4]
C5                    Gdim/Ab
  So dancing days are here   again
   F/C                 C5  F/C
As the summer evenings grow
                       Gdim/Ab
You are my flower, you are    my power
    F/G              C5
You are my woman who knows
 
 
[Chorus]
F/C                    Edim/F                     Dm/A
   I said it's alright,      You know it's alright
                        A    F/C
You know it's all in my heart
                  Edim/F               Dm/A
You'll be my only,      my one and only
Is that the way it should start?
                  G/D
I know that is all

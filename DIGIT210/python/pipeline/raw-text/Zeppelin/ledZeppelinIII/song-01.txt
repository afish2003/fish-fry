A

[Intro]
F#m
       A
Ah, ah.
 
 
[Verse 1]
   E
We come from the land
Of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun
Where the hot springs flow.
F#m
   The hammer of the gods,
Will drive our ships to new land.
To fight the hordes,
                 A
And sing and cry.
E                    F#m
Valhalla I am coming.
 
 
[Chorus]
A                 B
 On we sweep with, with threshing oars.
C
 Our only goal will be the western shore.
 
 
[Re-Intro]
F#m       A
   Ah, ah.
 
 
[Verse 2]
   E
We come from the land
Of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun
Where the hot springs flow.
F#m
   How soft your fields so green.
Can whisper tales of gore.
                                  A
Of how we calmed the tides of war.
E                       F#m
 We are your over Lords.
 
 
[Chorus]
A            B
 On we sweep, with threshing oars.
C
 Our only goal will be the western shore.
 
 
[Outro]
F#m
   So now you'd better stop,
And rebuild all your ruins.
For peace and trust can win the day,
                        Gm/C F#m
despite of all you're losing.
Gm/C F#m              Gm/C
        Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.
F#m
   Ooh.
        Gm/C
Ooh Ooh.
F#m   Gm/C
   Ah.
F#m Gm/C F#m     Gm/C F#m    Gm/C
            Ooh. Ooh.    Ooh.
F#m
   Ooh.
Gm/C F#m    Gm/C
Ooh.    Ooh.
F#m     Gm/C F#m
   Ooh. Ooh.
Ooh.

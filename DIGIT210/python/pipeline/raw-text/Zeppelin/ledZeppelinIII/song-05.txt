[Intro]
G F# A
      As I
 
 
[Verse 1 - 1]
F#
walk down the highway
        E          B7
All I do is sing a song
      F#
And a train that's passin' my way
      E                B7
Helps rhythm move along
F#                              E
Is no doubt about the words are clear
             B7                A
The voice is strong it's oh so strong
F# E F# E F#
 
 
[Verse 1 - 2]
F#
  Just simple guy
E                   B7
Live from day to day
  F#
A ray of sunshine melts my frown
E                  B7
Blows my blues away
F#
Nothin' more that I can say
         E
But on a day like today
         B7
Pass the time away
    A                      F# E F# E F#
And walk a quiet mile with you
 
 
[Chorus]
E      A                         E
 All I need from you is all your love
           A                    E        A
All you gotta give to me is all your love

[Verse 2 - 2]
F#
Standin' in the noonday sun
E                     B7
 Tryin' to flag a ride
F#
People go and people come
       E                     B7
See my rider right by my side
       F#
It's a total disgrace
They set the pace
   E
It must be race
    B7                     A
The best thing I can do is run
F# E F# E F#

A
Oh sweet mama, lay me down in my grave
D A
  Leave me baby, I'm too far gone to save
D    A
 The snow is comin', all the village folk know
D     A                                           D
 This wicked shiver, chills me down to my soul, oh
 
 
[Chorus]
Csus2     G         D
     Only time will tell
Csus2           G             D
Take the ox to town and you c an sell
           Csus2
Leave me in     my bed
G Bb6     C D
     Today

[Verse 2]
D    A
 The Yankee peddler bargains with you on his way
D A
  Woe sweet mama's gotten herself a new dray
D A
  Keep the children snug as the wagon rolls on
D     A                                                D
 When the cold wind blows most of them will be gone, oh
 
 
[Chorus]
Csus2     G     D
     Only time can tell
Csus2              G             D
Take the ox to town and I'll get well
           Csus2   G
Leave me in     my bed
Bb6     C D
   Today

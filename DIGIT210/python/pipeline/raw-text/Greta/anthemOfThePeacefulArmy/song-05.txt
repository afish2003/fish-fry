[Verse 1]
E5
Oh my holy lord
Sets my soul on fire
Flames of love and sweet perfume
                   A5  G5
She's my heart's desire
E5
She's an angel straight from hell
Draws me to the deep
In the darkness way below
                    A5  G5 E5 A5 G5
It's my heart she'll  keep
 
 
[Verse 2]
E5
Thunder underground
Watch the castle fall
Sound of wind it takes the sky
                   A5 G5 E5
Winter takes us all      Mountain high against the sky
Watches as we pray
Laughing out and smiling proud
                    A5 G5 E5
This is where we lay        Lover

[Verse 3]
E5
All night hellfire
Erase your memories
So he'll fall to his knees
                    A5 G5 E5
Watch the fire blaze      Satan plays flute for him
The sound it burns his ears
Watch his eyes
His piece of mind
 
 
[Chorus]
                    A5 G5 E5     D5 E5      D5 E5     D5 E5
Slips and disappears        Lover     Leaver     Taker     Believer
     E5 D5
Believer

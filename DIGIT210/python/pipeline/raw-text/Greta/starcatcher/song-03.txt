[Intro]
D5
 
 
[Verse 1]
D5
  I've been handed a quite demanding and hardly standing lie to tell
Life is sorted and never thwarted it's just supported by being well
Dm/F C/E                  Dm/F  C/E  G
        I don't want to loose this time
Bb                   C      Dm
  I just want to let it pass
 
 
[Chorus]
Dm  C  Bb
  Oh Oh  Oh
G
Holding up the falling sky
Dm  C  Bb
  Oh Oh  Oh
G
Holding up the falling sky
 
 
[Verse 2]
D5
  Here's the trouble with seeing double it's torn down rubble that's left behind
You can live with a pointless forte that silly board game that you would know
Dm/F C/E                  Dm/F  C/E  G
        I don't want to loose this time
Bb                   C      Dm
  I just want to let it pass
 
 
[Chorus]
Dm  C  Bb
  Oh Oh  Oh
G
Holding up the falling sky
Dm  C  Bb
  Oh Oh  Oh
G
Holding up the falling sky

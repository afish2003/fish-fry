Vengeance is a bow
                Bb           Cm
And arrows only justice when fired
Bb       Cm
  I have loved
I have lost
F        Cm     Bb
I am the archer!

Devil at the door
                  Bb          Cm
Standing with his right arm extended
Bb     Cm
  On a hunt
For the kill
F        Cm     Bb
I am the archer!

  Final blow
                Bb              Cm
My heaviness of breath has been lifted

  Let the world know my name
F        Cm     Bb
I am the archer!

  My home is on the horse I ride
What emptiness without my bride
Such heaviness inside
This was the day the archer died

D                            C  G
 We have shared with you our stories
D                          C   G
Had ourselves a really big time
D                               C   G
 Fought in battles far from the homeland
D                              C   G
Made love, even drank from the wine

 But I bid you a farewell
D                          C   G

 Friends how've come to sing in the chorus

You floor us, we will sing till the end

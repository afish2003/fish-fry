[Verse 1]
Bm                              D
I can see the faces through the broken glass
   E
No longer pass
Gmaj7 Bm                            D
      Looking at the sky, I see the city lights
    E             Gmaj7
But no star fights
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
D    A        G       Gmaj7
 I never want to fall asleep
  D               A          G       Gmaj7
Within my dreams, the weight we sow, we   reap
Bm         A          G    Gmaj7
  Though I believe the sun still shines
   Bm  A            G      Gmaj7
And  I believe there comes a    time
 
 
[Chorus]
Bm            A                G
  When out of silence, we will sing
Bm            A              G
  And even broken bells will ring
Bm            A               G
  Not all the answers are the same
    Bm       A            G
Yet we still play the game
 
 
[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Bm                               D
Sweeping off the pavement with a parlor broom
      E
Going nowhere soon
Gmaj7   Bm                                     D
     Between the cracks of sidewalk, there's a flower grown
      E         Gmaj7
Beyond the stone
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
D    A        G       Gmaj7
 I never want to fall asleep
  D               A          G       Gmaj7
Within my dreams, the weight we sow, we   reap
Bm         A          G    Gmaj7
  Though I believe the sun still shines
   Bm  A            G      Gmaj7
And  I believe there comes a    time
 
 
[Chorus]
Bm            A                G
  When out of silence, we will sing
Bm            A              G   Bm
  And even broken bells will ring
            A               G
Not all the answers are the same
    Bm       A            G
Yet we still play the game
    Bm       A            G Gmaj7
Yet we still play the game

[Verse 1]
F       C        Bb
Can you light my love?
F              C             Bb
Flames glowing bright as the sun
F            C         Bb
Deeper than oceans you run
F            C           Bb
Watch as our world has begun
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
     C                   Bb
Your mind is a stream of colors
  C                  Bb
Extending beyond our sky
  C                Bb
A land of infinite wonders
        C
Billion light years from here now

[Verse 2]
F           C           Bb
I have seen pictures of time
    F               C         Bb
The frames still in motion, I find
  F         C         Bb
A grand revolution outlined
F             C           Bb
Hate bound by fear will unwind
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
     C                   Bb
Your mind is a stream of colors
  C                  Bb
Extending beyond our sky
  C                Bb
A land of infinite wonders
        C
Billion light years from here now

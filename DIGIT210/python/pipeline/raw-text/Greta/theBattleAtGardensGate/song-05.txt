Dm           C
Perfect child
                         Gsus2
Plugged in since the womb
                   G
Prophet of the dune
                 F   G
In this electric tomb
Dm          C
Man has made
                    Gsus2
An omnipresent force
                   G
Heading on a course
                 F     G
For interstellar shores

Dm         C
God machine
                        Gsus2
Malfunctioned as it grew
                 G
And the circuits blew
                F  G
Falling down on you
Dm             C
Now you're free
                      Gsus2
Unplug from the source
                   G
No more underscores
            F    G
Open up the doors

God knows if you feel defeated

You have been cheated

You have  retreated

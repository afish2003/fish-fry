[Verse 1]
F                  Bb
 I've seen many people
F                  Bb
 There are so many people
F              Bb
 Some are much younger people
F                Bb
 And some are so old
F                  Bb
 I've seen many places
F                  Bb
 There are so many places
F                  Bb
 And where are the people going?
F                     Bb
 Will they choose the road?

[Chorus]
F               Bb   F               Eb     Bb
 I've packed my bags and I've got my freedom
Eb Bb F                Bb       F               Eb       Bb
       I've sacked the rules so I don't have to heed them
Eb Bb F             Bb    F                Eb   Bb
      I'll bet on a chance if I've just got  one
Eb Bb F                  Bb    F                   Eb Bb Eb Bb
      I'll throw out the plans and live with no burden

[Verse 2]
F                 Bb
 I have but a lifetime
F                          Bb
 Seems so long but it flies  by
F             Bb
 And in the moments passing
F             Bb
 I'll bear no load
F                 Bb
 I have yet to wander
F               Bb
 Many miles far yonder
F                     Bb
 And with so much left  to ponder
F             Bb
 I choose the road
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
F               Bb   F               Eb     Bb
 I've packed my bags and I've got my freedom
Eb Bb F                Bb       F               Eb       Bb
       I've sacked the rules so I don't have to heed them
Eb Bb F             Bb    F                Eb   Bb
      I'll bet on a chance if I've just got  one
Eb Bb F                  Bb    F                   Eb Bb Eb Bb
      I'll throw out the plans and live with no burden

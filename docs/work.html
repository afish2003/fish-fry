        This page highlights areas of work I’m actively involved in and developing, spanning digital media, web, and visual production. It reflects current interests and ongoing projects rather than finished portfolios.

        <p>
            My web work is exploratory and systems-focused, growing out of coursework and project-based experimentation. I’m particularly interested in testing emerging technologies and approaches as they relate to structure, markup, and long-term maintainability, rather than chasing surface-level trends. This site itself functions as a working space to experiment with layout and content organization instead of a finished product.

        <p>
            My current creative focus is on visual media, particularly film, photography, and immersive formats. I spend a lot of time working with lighting, cameras, and production systems through academic and lab-based projects. Many of these projects are still in development, and documentation will be added as the work becomes ready to share.

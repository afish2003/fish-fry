        <h2>Meehl Innovation Commons Ceramic 3D Printing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Currently I am working on a project for the First Energy Beta Lab. First Energy is one of the nations largest power providers.</li>
            <li>Due to an NDA being in place on this project, I have to be vauge in detail and cannot show photos of the actual project itself.</li>
            <li>Essentially I am helping them figure out how to print custom molds for them to be able to create specialized safety equiptment for employees with disabilities.</li>
            <li>They currently out source for this service and this causes employees to be unable to work until that equiptment is created.</li>     
        </ul>
        <h3>The Machine</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>First Energy a few years back purcheased us a Delta WASP 40100 LDM Clay 3D printer.</li>
            <li>Due to multiple issues with the way WASP designed their machine I have fully gone through it and made many improvements.</li>
            <li>The greatest improvement made to the machine is I converted it to use fresh mixed clay directly extruded from a clay mixer.</li>
            <li>This is much better than the origional WASP design which included a air chamber that forced the clay out causing a sponge effect and water loss from the clay</li>
        </ul>

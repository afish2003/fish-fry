        BOLD-C (Behrend Open Lab for Digital Creations) is where most of my current work, leadership, and creative output is centered. As Director, I oversee the lab’s operations, production work, and partnerships while helping shape it into a sustainable, student-driven media resource.

        <h2>Role & Scope</h2>
        <p>
            I currently serve as Director of BOLD-C, managing day-to-day operations, production systems, equipment infrastructure, and external collaborations. The role combines hands-on media production with systems thinking, balancing creative work with the development of workflows that allow the lab to function consistently over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            A significant portion of this work involves building infrastructure that extends beyond individual projects, including asset management systems, documentation, training workflows, and long-term planning for student involvement and lab sustainability.

        <h2>Production & Partnerships</h2>
        <p>
            Under my direction, BOLD-C supports and produces media for academic programs, research initiatives, and campus partners. This includes photography and promotional media for campus events, production of course and program videos, and ongoing support for experimental and immersive media projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            BOLD-C also serves as the primary media partner for the Behrend Theatre Department, producing headshots, production photography, and archival documentation across multiple seasons. This partnership provides students with consistent real-world production experience while supporting the department’s outreach and archival needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond campus, I have worked to expand BOLD-C’s professional network through partnerships with independent production companies, regional film festivals, and public media organizations across Pennsylvania.

        <h2>Student & Community Impact</h2>
        <p>
            A core goal of BOLD-C is providing students with access to professional tools, workflows, and networks. Through the lab’s productions and partnerships, students gain hands-on experience with industry-standard equipment, participate in professional development opportunities, and connect with working professionals in film, media, and related fields.
        </p>
        <p>
            These experiences have led to tangible outcomes including internships, collaborative projects, and ongoing mentorship relationships, while also strengthening connections between the university and the surrounding creative community.

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>
            BOLD-C is entering a period of continued growth, with upcoming productions, workshops, and training initiatives planned for the coming academic year. My focus moving forward is on maintaining a balance between experimentation and reliability, ensuring the lab remains adaptable, student-centered, and capable of supporting both exploratory creative work and professional-level production.

            <p>For this assignment I chose to scan my lighting storage room in Penn State Behrends Studio-Theatre</p>

            <h2>Comparison of two websites</h2>
            <p>For this assignment we created two sites: One site was a GitHub pages site created in HTML code and the other was a Wordpress site created in Penn States Wordpress utility. Overall I found the HTML to be significantly easier for many reasons. Below both methods will be compared and contrasted to show my opinions on them. </p>
            <p>As a new learner to both HTML and Wordpress I can say that both methods were difficult.  The biggest troubles surrounded formatting. In HTML formatting requires a CSS file which was very daunting as a beginner but now is relatively easy. Wordpress gives you templates which are kind of nice, but to make any edits to that template you have to go through a million menus and make your changes to each page of your site which is very frustrating and complex. </p>
            <p>An example of the frustrating complexity I experienced was when I wanted to add an image gallery to my Wordpress site. I spent an incredibly long time just figuring out how to format an image gallery on Wordpress natively and still to this very day have not figured it out. Every Wordpress help page I found online just told you to go into the text editor on Wordpress and use HTML code. If Wordpress is supposed to be easy and for a novice then why are they requiring you to use HTML to do the simplest of things? You can spend hours juggling through menu’s on Wordpress to do the same thing that 10 lines or less  of HTML code can do. With HTML you can legitimately do anything you want to your site with maybe at most 10 lines of code and a quick YouTube video. This is the greatest reason why I despise Wordpress and will suggest to anyone who asks</p>
            <p>In the end the skills required for both sites were the same. Although Wordpress required a little less HTML code both still required the use of it. If you do not have any skills in HTML you will be lost in creating a site via either method. Your options are either to learn HTML and spend hours just trying to get through the UI of Wordpress to save yourself a few extra lines of code or still learn HTML and make an actual HTML site and save yourself the struggle of using the absolute dog shit UI created by the genius’ at Wordpress. I will leave the final choice up to you but unless you are suicidal I highly suggest you avoid using Wordpress and use legitimately any other website creation platform in existence.</p>

            <h2>Corpus Analysis</h2>
            <p>For this assignment we utilized the tools Antconk and Voyant to do comparison of multiple sources. For my comparison I chose to use scripts of musicals. The musicals I chose are Ride the Cyclone, Wild Party, and Cabaret.</p>
            <p>These three shows both follow the same genre of dark comedy musicals but also are totally different shows. I wanted to utilize these comparison tools to figure out just what the differences were that separate these two shows from one another.</p>

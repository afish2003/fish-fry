        <p>Comparison of two websites for my DIGIT 100 Class</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For this assignment we were assigned to create two websites. One with Penn States Wordpress and the other a Github pages site done with HTML code. Overall I have found the HTML site to be a much more enjoyable creation experience. Wordpress I found to be extreemly clunky and hard to work with. You are forced to search through the entire site just to add the simplest actions to your site. Obviously the html site was not easy as a beginner but I found researching html to be easier than dealing with the clunky and overcomplicated UI of wordpress.</li>
